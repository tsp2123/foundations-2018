    "# Homework 10: Cleaning data with Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Time to use regular expressions!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hints and notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening files in subdirectories\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this notebook might be **homework/**, but!!! the csvs and text files might be in **homework/scraped/** or **/homework/scraped/minutes_pdfs** or **/homework/pdfs/**. To open a file in a subdirectory, instead of having the filename be `\"file.csv\"` you'll just use `\"some/subfolder/file.csv\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening text files\n",
    "\n",
    "This will open up a file, read it in and show you the first 500 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "contents = open(\"your-filename.txt\").read()\n",
    "contents[0:500]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> You might need `open(\"your-filename.txt\", encoding=\"utf8\").read()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using regex\n",
    "\n",
    "For some dumb reason you need to put `r` in front of the string you use when you're talking about regex. Just plain `\"(\\d\\d\\d)\"` will usually work, but *sometimes* it won't and you'll need `r\"(\\d\\d\\d)`. It's best to just use the `r` all of the time, if you can remember!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `.str.extract`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use `.str.extract`, you're always going to **capture one thing** and save it to a new column. You need to wrap the things you're interested in with parenthesis `(` `)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df['phone_number'] = df['old_column'].str.extract(r\"My phone number is (\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting pandas options\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has a lot of options, like how many columns or rows it will show you, or how many characters it will show in a column before it stops showing you anything. Here are a few useful ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `display.max_cols`: Number of columns to show at once\n",
    "* `display.max_rows`: Number of rows to show at once\n",
    "* `display.max_colwidth`: Maximum number of characters displayed from a string\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set them using `pd.set_option(\"display.max_rows\", 1000)`, for example, to show 1000 rows at a time. You can find a lot more at https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.set_option.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular expressions reference\n",
    "\n",
    "I personally think http://www.regular-expressions.info/ is a wonderful wonderful reference (and tutorial), even if it's ugly! But here's a quick reference for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\d` is a digit\n",
    "* `\\d*` is zero or more digits \n",
    "* `\\d+` is one or more digits\n",
    "* `.` matches anything for ONE character\n",
    "* `.*` is \"give me anything forever\"\n",
    "* `\\s` is whitespace, a.k.a. spaces and tabs\n",
    "* `\\w` is a word character, which includes capital and lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens.\n",
    "* You can put `*` after anything, so `\\w*` would mean \"as many word characters as you can find\"\n",
    "* `\\b` is a word boundary (you'll need the `r\"\"` thing for this one)\n",
    "* `( )` is a \"capture group\" for saving something\n",
    "* `\\1` is used when doing find/replace to say \"put the first captured group here\" (note, it's a dollar sign instead of a backslash in some editors)\n",
    "* `[ABCDE]` is a character class, which means \"match one of these, I don't care which\"\n",
    "* dollar sign means \"end of the line\"\n",
    "* caret ^ means \"beginning of the line\"\n",
    "* `\\.` means \"no really seriously I mean a period not just anything\"\n",
    "* You can use `\\` with anything else that would normally be a special character, too, not just periods. `(` or `[` or whatever.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning up extracted columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you get `\\n` (newlines) or spaces or `\\t` (tabs) or stuff at the beginning or the end of your column. `.str.strip()` will usually take care of that, just attach it after your `.str.extract()`\n",
    "\n",
    "After you extract something, it's still a string even though you look at it and know it's a number. Use `.astype(int)` to turn it into an integer (no decimal) or `.astype(float)` to turn it into a float (yes decimal)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing regular expressions in general\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if I'm using regex in pandas or Python, I like to test them in my text editor with \"Find.\" The highlighting really helps me see if I'm matching things! I also like to think \"what stays the same?\" when designing patterns, write those parts first, then fill in the blanks with what I want to capture."

    "\n",
    "Open up `hm.csv` from the `scraped` directory. I want **four new columns**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `price_original`, the original price, one of the new price\n",
    "2. `price_discounted`, the discounted price\n",

    "**Tip:** Remember that `$` is a special regex symbol! You might need to escape it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** When doing `.str.extract`, the whole match doesn't get captured, only what you put `()` around! Think about anchoring to different points of the string, or things in the string.\n",

All  allegations  relate  to  his  handling  of  confidential  data  in  December  2007 \\nand January 2008 and his participation in the follow-up investigation in 2009 and 2010. \\nApplicant was assured that “trusted downloads” provided by the Navy and Company L \\ndid not contain classified information, when two of them contained a mix of unclassified \\nand  classified  information.

All  allegations  relate  to  his  handling  of  confidential  data  in  December  2007 \\nand January 2008 and his participation in the follow-up investigation in 2009 and 2010. \\nApplicant was assured that “trusted downloads” provided by the Navy and Company L \\ndid not contain classified information, when two of them contained a mix of unclassified \\nand  classified  information.  Applicant  and  his  team  members  transferred  the  trusted \\ndownloads onto computers that were for unclassified use only. There was no evidence \\nthat any of the classified information was viewed by anyone not authorized to view it. \\nApplicant made some judgment errors in his reaction to the discovery of the classified \\ninformation.
