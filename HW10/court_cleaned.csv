In the matter of: 
 
 
 
Applicant for Security Clearance 

REDACTED 

 

ISCR Case No. 11-11916 

MENDEZ, Francisco, Administrative Judge: 

 
Applicant  did  not  mitigate  security  concerns  raised  by  his  exercise  of  foreign 
citizenship,  including  the  possession  of  a  current  foreign  passport.  He  also  did  not 
mitigate  security  concerns  raised  by  his  substantial  ties  to  Russia  through  which  he 
could be subjected to adverse foreign influence. Clearance is denied. 
 

History of the Case 

On August 15, 2009, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). 
He  voluntarily  disclosed  his  dual  U.S.-Russian  citizenship,  as  well  as  his  connections 
and property interest in Russia.  

 
On  April  17,  2014,  the  Department  of  Defense  Consolidated  Adjudications 
Facility sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging that his circumstances 
raised security concerns under the foreign preference and foreign influence guidelines.1 
                                                           
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the 
Adjudicative Guidelines implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.

On  July  26,  2014,  Applicant  answered  the  SOR,  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations, 
waived  his  right  to  a  hearing,  and  elected  to  have  his  case  decided  on  the  written 
record.2  
 
 
On  July  22,  2015,  Department  Counsel  prepared  a  file  of  relevant  material 
(FORM) and sent it to Applicant. The FORM contains the SOR, Applicant’s answer, and 
responses to two interrogatories, which were admitted into the record as Exhibits 1 – 4. 
Department Counsel also submitted with the FORM a request for administrative notice, 
Exhibit (Ex.) 5, which is discussed below.  
 
 
provided 30 days from its receipt to file a response, but did not submit one. 
 
 
On December 1, 2015, I was assigned Applicant’s case and provided a copy of 
the  FORM.  On  my  own  motion,  I  opened  the  record  to  provide  him  a  last  chance 
opportunity  to  submit  a  response  to  the  FORM.  He  was  also  advised  of  the  serious 
security concerns raised by his possession of a current foreign passport and that such 
concerns may be mitigated by surrendering or relinquishing the passport as set forth in 
the Directive.4 Applicant did not submit a response or provide additional documentation. 
The record closed on December 15, 2015. 
 

On  August  31,  2015,  Applicant  acknowledged  receipt  of  the  FORM.3  He  was

Government reports. Additionally, the official position of relevant federal agencies or the 
pertinent statements of key U.S. Government officials regarding a foreign country may 
be appropriate for administrative notice. The party requesting administrative notice of a 
particular matter must provide the source document, either the pertinent parts or the full 
document,  to  allow  the  judge  and,  if  necessary,  the  Appeal  Board  to  assess  the 
reliability, accuracy, and relevancy of any administratively noticed fact. See generally, 
ISCR Case No. 08-09480 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2010); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. 
Apr. 12, 2007).  
 

Department Counsel did not submit the source documents (or, relevant portions 
thereof)  with  the  FORM.  Instead,  Department  Counsel’s  request  for  administrative 
notice, Ex. 5, cites to the web addresses where the source documents can be located. 
Recently,  the  Appeal  Board  held  that,  irrespective  of  whether  an  applicant  raises  an 
objection to a matter requested for administrative notice, citation to a web address alone 
is  insufficient.  The  Board  went  on  to  reiterate  its  long-held  position  that  the  actual 
source  document  the  judge  relies  upon  for  an  administratively  noticed  fact  must  be

remanded because the source documents not included in the record.5  

 
Accordingly, I have marked and included in the record as Hearing Exhibit IV the 
source  documents  (or,  the  pertinent  portions  thereof),  which  provide  a  basis  for  the 
following relevant facts regarding Russia:6 
 
Russia “has a highly centralized, weak multi-party political system dominated by 
 
President Vladimir Putin.”7 A recent human rights report from the U.S. State Department 
reflects that the Russian government committed significant human rights violations and 
“the [Russian] government failed to take adequate steps to prosecute or punish most 
officials who committed abuses, resulting in a climate of impunity.”8 
 
 
In  2015,  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  reported  to  Congress  that  the 
leading  state  intelligence  threats  to  the  United  States  will  continue  to  come  from  two 
main countries, one of which is Russia.9 
 

 
Applicant was born, raised, and educated in Russia. He received a commission 
as an officer in Russia’s reserve military forces and worked for a time for the Russian 
Defense Ministry. He immigrated to the United States in 1997 and married his wife, who 
is also originally from Russia, in 2002. They have one child, who was born in the United 
States.  
 

Applicant  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2005.  Applicant,  his  wife,  and  his  child  all 
have  dual  U.S.-Russian  citizenships.  Since  becoming  a  U.S.  citizen,  Applicant  has 
                                                           
5  Department  Counsel’s  “failure”  to  submit  the  source  documents  is  understandable  as  the  FORM 
predates  the  cited  Appeal  Board  decision.  Arguably,  Ex.  5  could  be  admitted  as  a  summary  of  the 
pertinent  facts  contained  in  the  source  documents.  See  generally,  Directive,  Enclosure  3,  ¶  E3.1.19 
(Federal Rules of Evidence (F.R.E.) shall serve as a guide in DOHA proceedings and technical rules of 
evidence may be relaxed to permit the development of a full and complete record); F.R.E. 201; F.R.E. 
1006. However, based on the present record, I cannot find that Applicant’s failure to raise an objection to 
Ex. 5 amounts to an agreement as to the exhibits accuracy, reliability, and relevancy. Contrast with, ISCR 
Case No. 14-03112 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2015), after applicant concurred with its content, the only evidence 
regarding the foreign country was the administrative notice request that was admitted as a summary. 
 
6 Applicant was provided notice regarding these source documents with the FORM. He was also provided 
ample opportunity to challenge or provide additional information regarding the matters requested by the 
Government for administrative notice. Although the Government’s citation to 26 source documents raises 
potential notice and fairness concerns, the additional time Applicant was provided to respond and provide 
additional information ameliorated any such concerns.

voted  in  Russian  elections  and  twice  renewed  his  Russian  passport.  His  current 
Russian passport is due to expire in 2022. He is unwilling to surrender or relinquish his 
Russian passport because he may need it to travel to Russia on short notice to visit his 
elderly parents.  
 

Applicant has a number connections and contacts in Russia. Notably, Applicant’s 
parents  and  his  wife’s  mother  and  her  siblings  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Russia. 
Applicant’s  father  used  to  work  for  the  Russian  government.  His  parents  are  now 
retired.  Applicant  has  traveled  to  Russia  to  visit  his  family,  with  his  most  recent  trip 
occurring in 2012. He has used his Russian passport to travel to Russia. He owns an 
apartment in Russia, which he has left to his parents to dispose of as they see fit. He 
and his wife maintain contact with their relatives and at least one friend in Russia. 

 

 

Policies 

“[N]o  one  has  a  ‘right’  to  a  security  clearance.”  Department  of  the  Navy  v. 
Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  528  (1988).  Individual  applicants  are  eligible  for  access  to 
classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent  with  the  national 
interest” to authorize such access. E.O. 10865 § 2. 

 
When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  eligibility 

for  a  security  clearance,  an 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory  explanations,  the  guidelines  list  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating 
conditions.  The  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the 
complexities  of  human  behavior,  an  administrative  judge  applies  the  guidelines  in  a  
commonsense manner, considering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a 
fair and impartial decision.  

 
Department  Counsel  must  present  evidence  to  establish  controverted  facts 
alleged  in  the  SOR.  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14.  Applicants  are  responsible  for  presenting 
“witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by 
the applicant or proven . . . and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a 
favorable clearance decision.” Directive ¶ E3.1.15.  

 
Administrative Judges are responsible for ensuring that due process proceedings 
are conducted “in a fair, timely and orderly manner.” Directive ¶ E3.1.10. Judges make 
certain  that  an  applicant  receives  fair  notice  of  the  issues  raised,  has  a  reasonable 
opportunity to litigate those issues, and is not subjected to unfair surprise. ISCR Case 
No. 12-01266 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2014).  

 
In  resolving  the  ultimate  question  regarding  an  applicant’s  eligibility,  an 
administrative judge must resolve “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered 
for  access  to  classified  information  .  .  .  in  favor  of  national  security.”  AG  ¶  2(b). 
Moreover, recognizing the difficulty at times in making suitability determinations and the 
paramount importance of protecting national security, the Supreme Court has held that

“security  clearance  determinations  should  err,  if  they  must,  on  the  side  of  denials.” 
Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  

the  Government  predicated  upon 

 
A  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary 
 
relationship  with 
trust  and  confidence.  This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of 
trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it  grants  access  to  classified  information. 
Decisions  include,  by  necessity,  consideration  of  the  possible  risk  an  applicant  may 
deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions 
entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible  extrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than 
actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
 

Clearance  decisions  must  be  made  “in  terms  of  the  national  interest  and  shall 
in  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the  applicant  concerned.”  E.O. 
10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance amounts to a finding that an 
applicant,  at  the  time  the  decision  was  rendered,  did  not  meet  the  strict  guidelines 
established for determining eligibility for access to classified information. 

 

Analysis 

 

Guideline C, Foreign Preference  
 
 
Under  AG  ¶  9,  the  foreign  preference  security  concern  arises  “[w]hen  an 
individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the 
United States.” Applicant actively exercised his foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. 
citizen,  including  voting  in  Russian  elections  and  renewing,  using,  and  maintaining  a 
Russian passport. This record evidence raises the foreign preference security concern 
and  establishes  the  disqualifying  condition  at  AG  ¶  10(a).10  The  foreign  preference 
guideline also sets forth a number of potential mitigation conditions. I have considered 
all the mitigating conditions and none apply. Notably, Applicant currently has a foreign 
passport and is unwilling to relinquish or surrender it. A current or prospective clearance 
holder  is  ineligible  for  a  security  clearance  unless  s/he  surrenders  it  to  the  cognizant 
security authority (CSA), invalidates the foreign passport, or receives approval from the 
CSA for his/her continued possession and use of the foreign passport. See AG ¶¶ 11(d) 
and  11(e).  Applicant  did  not  supply  any  information  that  any  of  the  preceding 
circumstances apply. Accordingly, foreign preference security concerns remain.  
 
Guideline B, Foreign Influence 
 

The foreign influence security concern is explained at AG ¶ 6:  
 
Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual 
has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or 
induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a

An individual is not automatically disqualified from holding a security clearance 
because they have connections and interests in a foreign country. Instead, in assessing 
an individual’s vulnerability to foreign influence, an administrative judge must take into 
account  the  foreign  government  involved;  the  intelligence  gathering  history  of  that 
government; the country’s human rights record; and other pertinent factors.12  
 
Applicant  and  his  wife’s  connections  and  property  interest  in  Russia  raise  the

foreign  ties.  Furthermore,  an  applicant  is  not  required  “to  sever  all  ties  with  a  foreign 
country before he or she can be granted access to classified information.”13 However, 
what  factor  or  combination  of  factors  will  mitigate  security  concerns  raised  by  an 
applicant  with  family  members  in  a  foreign  country  is  not  easily  identifiable  or 
quantifiable.14  An  administrative  judge’s  predictive  judgment  in  these  types  of  cases 
must be guided by a commonsense assessment of the evidence and consideration of 
the adjudicative guidelines, as well as the whole-person factors set forth in the Directive. 
A judge’s ultimate determination must also take into account the overarching standard 
in  all  security  clearance  cases,  namely,  that  any  doubt  raised  by  an  applicant’s 
circumstances must be resolved in favor of national security. AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
 
I  have  considered  all  the foreign  influence mitigating  conditions and,  based  on 
the  record  evidence,  none  apply.  Even  if  I  assume  for  the  sake  of  argument  that 
Applicant’s property and non-familial connections in Russia are not significant enough to 
cause  a  conflict  of  interest  with  his  security  obligations,  his  and  his  wife’s  close 
relationship to their family members in Russia raise a concern about his vulnerability or 
susceptibility to adverse foreign influence. Applicant’s relatives in Russia are subject to 
the dictates of a government whose respect for human rights and the rule of law is, at 
best, questionable.  Moreover, Russia has been identified by the U.S. Government as 
continuing  to  pose  an  intelligence  threat.  Applicant’s  familial  connections  in  Russia, 
coupled with the threat posed by the current Russian government to its own people and 
the security threat it poses to the United States, raises a heightened risk that Applicant 
could  be  subjected  to  adverse  foreign  influence.  Applicant  did  not  present  sufficient 
information  to  mitigate  this  security  concern.  However,  this  adverse  finding  is  “not  a 
comment on Applicant’s patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act 
in unpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved-one, 
such as a family member.” ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009). 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 
Under  the  whole-person  concept,  an  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the 
nine factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a).15 I hereby incorporate my comments under Guidelines 
B and C. I gave due consideration to all the favorable and extenuating factors in this 
case, including Applicant’s honesty about his foreign connections from the start of the 
security  clearance  process.  Furthermore,  I  recognize  that  Applicant  left  Russia  nearly

15 The non-exhaustive list of factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances  surrounding  the  conduct,  to  include  knowledgeable  participation;  (3)  the  frequency  and 
recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which  participation  is  voluntary;  (6)  the  presence  or  absence  of  rehabilitation  and  other  permanent 
behavioral  changes;  (7)  the  motivation  for  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion, 
exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

20 years ago and has made the United States his home. However, his possession of a 
current  Russian  passport  and  close  familial  connections  in  Russia  through  whom  he 
could  be  adversely  influenced  raise  serious  security  concerns.  Accordingly,  after 
weighing  the  favorable  and  unfavorable  evidence,  I  find  that  he  failed  to  mitigate  the 
security concerns at issue. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts about 
his eligibility for access to classified information. 
 

Conclusion 

 

 
In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. 
Applicant’s request for a security clearance is denied.

APPEAL BOARD DECISION

APPEARANCES

FOR GOVERNMENT

James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel

FOR APPLICANT

Pro se

The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On
August 19, 2015, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision
on the written record.  On June 27, 2016, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings
and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant’s request for a
security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.

Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in making findings
of fact and whether the Judge’s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent
with the following, we affirm.

The Judge’s Findings of Fact  

Applicant is 46 years old, married, and has four children.  He earned a bachelor’s degree in
1994.    Since  2010,  he  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor.    In  his  security  clearance
application, he explained that he encountered difficultly paying bills in 2008 after being laid off
from a second job due to the company’s bankruptcy.  He gave no explanation for why he did not
begin attempting to resolve the debts until the issuance of the SOR.

Applicant admitted each of the five delinquent debts alleged in the SOR.  For the debt in
SOR  ¶  1.a  for  about  $500,  Applicant  wrote  in  his  Response  to  Department  Counsel’s  File  of
Relevant Material (FORM) that the debt was paid off.  The creditor agreed to accept three monthly
payments of about $100 to settle the debt.  A document showed the creditor made arrangements with
Applicant to debit electronically about $100 from his account in September 2015 for this debt.  For
the 2009 judgment in SOR ¶ 1.b for about $14,000, Applicant indicated that, at the time he answered
the SOR, he was unable to negotiate a settlement.  In his Response to the FORM, he provided
documents showing his wages were being garnished biweekly for the next six months for this debt
and about $350 was garnished from his pay at the end of November 2015.  No evidence was
presented to establish the total amount deducted from his pay or how much is still owed on that debt. 
For the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.b, and 1.c for about $2,500, $5,600, and $3600, Applicant wrote in
his Response to the FORM that he is currently on a schedule to repay between $150 and $190 a
month on each debt until it is resolved.  He provided proof of payments toward those debts from
September through November 2015.

The Judge’s Analysis

The  Judge  found  Applicant  did  not  act  responsibly  because,  even  though  he  has  been
employed by his current employer since 2010, he only began making payments towards the debts
after the SOR was issued.  The Judge also concluded that, while the mitigation condition concerning
the initiation of a good-faith effort to repay the creditors was applicable, it was not controlling
because Applicant must establish a consistent history of continuing to resolve his debts. 

Discussion

2

In the appeal brief, Applicant provided character reference letters and documents showing
payments  on,  or  settlement  of,  various  debts.    Most  of  those  documents,  however,  were  not
previously submitted to the Judge and constitute new evidence that the Appeal Board is prohibited
from receiving or considering.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  

Applicant claims the Judge erred in the findings of fact.  For example, he states that he has
six children (instead of four) and started working for his current employer in 2012 (instead of 2010). 
In  his  security  clearance  application,  however,  Applicant  listed  that  he  had  four  children  and
indicated he started working for his employer in 2010.  He failed to establish that the Judge erred
in the findings of fact.  Our review reveals the Judge’s material findings are based upon substantial
evidence or constitute reasonable inferences or conclusions that could be drawn from the record
evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. July 25, 2014).  Applicant also argues
that he mitigated the security concerns arising from his debts.  His arguments are not sufficient to
show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to
law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06634 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 28, 2016).   
   

The Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the
decision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general standard is that a clearance may
be granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’” Department
of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b):  “Any doubt
concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor
of the national security.”

The Decision is AFFIRMED.

LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 

 
Applicant  mitigated  the  financial  considerations  security  concerns.  Eligibility  for 

access to classified information is granted.  
 

Statement of the Case 

On October 28, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons  (SOR)  to  Applicant  detailing  security  concerns  under  Guideline  F,  financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)  implemented  by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006. 

 
Applicant  responded  to  the  SOR  on  November  14,  2014,  and  requested  a 
hearing  before  an  administrative  judge.  The  case  was  originally  assigned  to  me  on 
February 27, 2015. Scheduling of the case was delayed because Applicant was working 
overseas. The case was reassigned to me on May 4, 2015. After coordinating with the 
parties, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing 

 

 
1 

on  July  16,  2015,  scheduling  the  hearing  for  August  18,  2015.  The  hearing  was 
convened  as  scheduled.  DOHA  received  the  hearing  transcript  (Tr.)  on  August  26, 
2015.  
 

Evidentiary Rulings 

Government  Exhibits  (GE)  1,  2,  4,  5,  and  6  were  admitted  in  evidence  without 
objection. GE 3 was admitted over Applicant’s objection. Applicant testified, called five 
witnesses, and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through Z, which were admitted 
without  objection.  The  record  was  held  open  for  Applicant  to  submit  additional 
information. He submitted documents that I have marked AE AA and BB1 and admitted 
without objection.  
 

Findings of Fact 

 

 

 
 
Applicant is a 57-year-old self-employed contractor for a defense contractor. He 
served  in  the  U.S.  military  from  1979  until  he  retired  in  2000.  He  seeks  to  retain  a 
security clearance, which he has held since he was in the military. He attended college 
for a period, but he is a few credits shy of a degree. His first marriage ended in divorce. 
He has been married to his current spouse for more than 25 years. He has two adult 
children.2 
 
 
Applicant spent the majority of his military career in special operations. He went 
on  numerous  combat  missions,  conducted  clandestine  insertions,  and  operated 
undercover.  When  he  retired  he  became  an  entrepreneur  and  started  his  own 
companies.  His  primary  company  was  incorporated,  but  Applicant  had  to  personally 
guarantee many of the company’s liabilities. He also invested in real estate. His primary 
company  suffered  significant  setbacks  during  the  recession  and  housing  crisis  of  the 
later part of the 2000s. His real estate properties lost much of their value. He closed his 
primary  company  in  2009  and  has  been  working  since  then  as  a  self-employed 
contractor and subcontractor for other companies. He has spent much of the last five 
years working overseas in dangerous assignments.3 
 
  
The SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, which include a $58,161 judgment (SOR 
¶  1.a),  mortgage  loans  (SOR  ¶  1.c  -  $30,994;  SOR  ¶  1.d  -  $351,562;  SOR  ¶  1.e  - 
$271,900; and SOR ¶ 1.f - $50,688), two business-related debts (SOR ¶ 1.b - $18,028 
and SOR ¶ 1.h - $77,115) and federal taxes (SOR ¶ 1.g - $33,882 for tax year 2008, 
and SOR ¶ 1.i – no amount alleged for tax years 2012 and 2013). Applicant admitted 
owing most of the debts at some point, but several of the debts were paid, settled, or 
otherwise resolved.

Applicant’s primary company was growing, and it leased a larger warehouse in 
about  2008.  The  business  ultimately  failed,  and  the  company  broke  the  lease.  The 
owner of the warehouse sued  Applicant  personally  and  obtained a $58,161 judgment 
against  him  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  Applicant’s  attorney  is  negotiating  a  settlement  on  this 
judgment.4  
 
 
Applicant and a partner had a falling out over the business. The ex-partner sued 
Applicant  for  $160,000.  They  reached  a  settlement  through  arbitration  in  which 
Applicant agreed to pay the ex-partner $163,000 by 2010. He paid about $86,000, but 
he  was  unable  to  pay  the  remainder  when  the  company  closed.  The  partner  either 
obtained  a  judgment  for  $77,000  or  sought  to  enforce  the  arbitrated  settlement. 
Applicant’s  attorney  is  negotiating  a  settlement  for  the  remainder  owed  to  the  ex-
partner.5 
 
In February 2013, Applicant settled the $20,302 business credit card debt alleged 
 
in  SOR  ¶  1.b  (alleged  as  $18,028  in  SOR)  for  $10,151,  which  was  paid  in  February 
2013. Applicant submitted proof in his response to DOHA interrogatories in May 2014 
that the debt had been settled. The February 2014 credit report lists the account with a 
zero balance, with the annotation that it was transferred, sold, and paid.6 
 
 
Applicant was due a refund from his 2007 federal income taxes, but he owed the 
IRS for tax year 2008. The IRS filed a $33,882 tax lien against Applicant in June 2010 
(SOR ¶ 1.g). In January 2011, the IRS applied his $15,892 refund from his 2007 taxes 
to his 2008 taxes. Applicant paid the remaining $5,689 owed for 2008 in January 2013. 
The  2014  credit  reports  obtained  by  the  Government  report  the  lien  as  released  in 
January 2013.7 
 
 
Applicant owed the IRS $65,863 for his 2012 and 2013 federal income taxes. In 
April  2015,  he  submitted  a  proposed  installment  agreement  to  the  IRS  whereby  he 
would  pay  an  initial  $915  and  then  $500  per  month  until  paid.  In  July  2015,  the  IRS 
accepted  Applicant’s  installment  agreement  and  added  his  2014  taxes.  On  June  5, 
2015,  Applicant  paid  the  IRS  $56,415  for  his  2014  taxes.  On  July  9,  2015,  he  paid 
$10,000 toward his estimated taxes for 2015.8 
 
 
Applicant used to own five properties consisting of his residence and four rental 
properties. Some of his tenants did not pay their rent, and he also had a property vacant 
for an extended period. Applicant bought his home and another property when he was 
in the military. He still has those properties, plus another, but he lost two properties to 
foreclosure.  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.f  allege  the  first  ($351,562)  and  second  ($50,688)

mortgage loans on one of the foreclosed properties. The $351,562 figure is listed on the 
credit  reports  as  the  high  credit  on  the  first  mortgage  loan,  not  a  balance.  The  2010 
credit report lists the account before foreclosure as $8,609 past due, with a $274,274 
balance. The more recent credit reports list the first mortgage loan as foreclosed with a 
zero balance. TransUnion reported in August 2015: “Credit grantor reclaimed collateral 
to settle defaulted mortgage[.] Foreclosure proceedings started[.]”9 
 
The  second  mortgage  loan  is  listed  on  the  three  oldest  credit  reports  with  a 
 
$50,688  balance.  Equifax  reported  a  $50,688  balance  in  the  combined  credit  report 
from  August  2015.  TransUnion  reported  the  loan  as  closed  with  a  zero  balance. 
Applicant’s  online  account  snapshot  of  the  second  mortgage  loan  shows  a  zero 
balance.  Applicant  stated  that  he  thought  the  first  and  second  mortgage  loans  were 
resolved by the foreclosure. He has never been contacted by the holders of the first and 
second mortgage loans seeking a deficiency owed on the loans.10 
 
 
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  the  mortgage  loan  ($271,900)  on  the  second  foreclosed 
property.  The  $271,900  figure  is  listed  on  the  credit  reports  as  the  high  credit  on  the 
mortgage loan, not a balance. The reports list a zero balance for the loan. The 2010 and 
2015  credit  reports  list  the  account  as  “Foreclosure  redeemed,”  and  “Credit  grantor 
reclaimed collateral to settle defaulted mortgage[.]” Applicant has never been contacted 
about a deficiency owed on the loan.11 
 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges the $30,994 charged-off second mortgage loan on Applicant’s 
home. He settled the debt for $7,517, which he paid in August 2015. Applicant is current 
on  the  first  mortgage  loan  on  his  residence  and  the  mortgage  loans  on  his  two 
remaining investment properties.12 
 
 
Applicant paid other debts that were not alleged in the SOR. He repaid a $10,000 
loan from his former commanding officer. He borrowed $50,000 from a friend who he 
served with in the military in an effort to maintain his business. He paid the friend and 
then his friend’s widow after his friend passed away. Applicant made the last payment of 
$14,000 in August 2015.13 
 
 
Applicant’s accountant, friends, and business associates recommended that he 
file  bankruptcy  to  discharge  the  debts  accrued  from  his  failed  business  and  the  real 
estate collapse. He chose not to file bankruptcy because he wanted to pay his debts, 
and he was afraid that a bankruptcy would adversely affect his security clearance. He 
has  been  working  overseas  under  dangerous  conditions  during  the  last  five  years  to

take time, but he is committed to resolving all his debts.14  
 
 
Applicant’s character evidence was extraordinary. He submitted numerous letters 
and  several  witnesses  testified.  Many  of  the  authors  and  witnesses  served  with 
Applicant in special operations. His former commanding officer testified that he served 
with  Applicant  under  conditions  that  the  commanding  officer  modesty  described  as 
“quite  stressful.”  The  endorsements  of  the  witnessses  and  authors  were  unequivocal 
and exceptional.15 
 

Policies 

 

When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability 

 
the 
administrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 

for  a  security  clearance, 

These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the 
complexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables 
known  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all 
available,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and  present,  favorable  and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 

 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  

 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  

the  Government  predicated  upon 

 
A  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary 
 
relationship  with 
trust  and  confidence.  This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard 
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible

information. 
 

Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national  interest  and  shall  in  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 

 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 

Analysis 

The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       

Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet 
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or 
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise 
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to 
protect  classified 
financially 
overextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 

information.  An 

individual  who 

is 

(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred 
under  such  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast 
doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good 
judgment; 

(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely 
beyond  the  person’s  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business 
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 

 
6 

AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   

 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 

 

(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 

 
 
 
evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  
 
  
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 

Applicant  had  delinquent  debts  that  he  was  unable  or  unwilling  to  pay.  The 

Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 

 

 

 

 

(c)  the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the  problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 

(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 

 
Applicant owed and still owes a lot of money, but the SOR overstated his debts. 
  
The evidence available to the Government (credit reports and documents submitted by 
Applicant in response to interrogatories) established that before the SOR was issued, 
Applicant  settled  the  $18,028  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b,  and  he  paid  the  IRS  the 
$33,882 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. Additionally, the SOR alleged the high credit on the two 
mortgage  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d  -  $351,562  and  1.e  -  $271,900),  when  the  balances  on 
those loans were reported as zero.  
 
  
Applicant paid his 2008 federal income taxes. He has a payment plan in place for 
his  2012  and  2013  tax  years.  He  settled  and  paid  the  second  mortgage  loan  on  his 
home,  and  he  paid  other  debts  that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  His  attorney  is 
negotiating  settlements  for  the  two  judgments  against  him.  Applicant  credibly  testified 
that it will take time, but he is committed to resolving all his debts. 
 
 
I find that Applicant established a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he 
took significant action to implement that plan. He acted responsibly and made a good-
faith effort to pay his debts. There are clear indications that his financial problems are 
being  resolved  and  are  under  control.  They  occurred  under  circumstances  that  are 
unlikely  to  recur  and  do  not  cast  doubt  on  his  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and 
good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are applicable. AG ¶ 20(b) is partially applicable. 
AG ¶ 20(a) is not yet completely applicable because Applicant is still in the process of 
paying his debts.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an 
 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 

 

 

 

the  conduct, 

the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of 
to 

the  conduct;  (2) 
the 
(1) 
circumstances  surrounding 
include  knowledgeable 
participation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which  participation 
the  presence  or  absence  of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 

is  voluntary;  (6) 

 
7 

 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 

I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions  in  light  of  all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  

 
Applicant’s  character  evidence  was  extraordinary.  His  financial  problems  are 
large, but not insurmountable. Applicant credibly testified that he will eventually resolve 
all his debts. His sacrifices in service to this country have earned him the time to do so. 

 
Overall,  the  record  evidence  leaves  me  without  questions  or  doubts  as  to 
Applicant’s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a  security  clearance.  I  conclude  Applicant 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  
 

Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 

Formal Findings 

 
 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 

 

 
In  light  of  all  of  the  circumstances  presented  by  the  record  in  this  case,  it  is 
clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  continue  Applicant’s  eligibility  for  a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.

Statement of the Case 

On April 5, 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility  (CAF)  issued  Applicant  a  Statement  of  Reasons  (SOR)  detailing  security 
concerns under Guideline F. DOD CAF took that action under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding  Classified  Information  Within  Industry,  dated  February  20,  1960,  as 
amended;  DOD  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance 
Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on September 1, 2006. 

The SOR detailed reasons why DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant  a  security  clearance.  On  April  30,  2015,  Applicant  answered  the  SOR  and 
requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on August 26, 2015. The Defense

Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on September 3, 
2015, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on September 22, 2015.  

 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 
4. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F. The record of 
the  proceedings  was  left  open  until  October  5,  2015,  to  provide  Applicant  the 
opportunity to submit additional documents. He timely submitted documents that were 
marked as AE G thought I. All exhibits were admitted into evidence without objections. 
DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 30, 2015. 
 

Procedural Matters 

 

 
Department Counsel made a motion to withdraw the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d 
and 1.e. Applicant had no objection to the motion. The motion was granted, and those 
allegations were withdrawn.1 
 
 
Department Counsel made a motion to amend SOR ¶ 1.a to reflect that the debt 
was owed to a state instead of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Applicant had no 
objection to the amendment. The motion to amend was granted.2 
 

Findings of Fact 

 
 
Applicant is a 40-year-old mechanic who works as a quality assurance inspector 
for  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been  working  for  that  contractor  in  the  Middle  East 
since May 2011 and has worked overseas for other defense contractors for a number of 
years.  He  earned  a  general  educational  development  certificate  in  1996  and  an 
associate’s degree in 2003. He has been married twice. He married his current wife in 
2005. He has three children, ages 15, 16, and 22.3 
 

Excluding  the  withdrawn  allegations,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  three 
delinquent  debts  totaling  $64,168  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c).  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  he 
denied each debt. Substantial evidence of the alleged debts is contained in GE 1-4.4  

 
In 1999, Applicant was involved in a car accident and incurred a broken pelvis 
and hip. He was determined to be fully disabled and collected about $1,000 per month 
in disability payments from the Social Security Administration (SSA). While receiving the 
disability benefits, he knew there was a limit on how much income he could earn, but 
did not know the exact restrictions. In 2006, he received a letter from SSA that indicated

he was earning more income than he was allowed. At that time, his disability payments 
stopped, and he has not received any further disability payments since then.5 

 
A credit report dated June 12, 2010, reflected that Applicant’s SSA account had 
been  placed  for  collection  in  the  amount  of  $20,955  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  This  delinquent 
account was the result of his overpayment of disability payments. In 2008, he started 
repaying this debt through a monthly pay allotment of $300. When he left his job later 
that year, the allotment stopped. In 2012, the SSA began garnishing his pay at a rate of 
$600 every two weeks. By early 2014 (well before the issuance of the SOR), he fully 
repaid this debt. In July 2014, he received a letter from the SSA stating he overpaid the 
debt and would be receiving a refund of $2,535.6 

 
In 2008 and 2009, Applicant worked overseas, and a portion of his income was 
exempt from taxation. In those years, his income was greater than the exemption, and 
he incurred taxes that he could not pay. In his security clearance application (SCA), he 
disclosed that he owed approximately $36,000 to the IRS for 2008 and 2009 (SOR ¶ 
1.b). In 2010, his state also filed a $7,213 tax lien against him (SOR ¶ 1.a).7 

 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that the state tax lien had been repaid 
through monthly payroll deductions. He also stated that he had a repayment plan with 
the IRS and the payments are automatically deducted from his pay.8  

  
At the hearing, Applicant testified that the state tax lien was repaid, but he had 
not  yet  received  a  document  from  the  state  showing  it  was  paid.  He  stated  that  the 
deductions from his pay for the state tax lien stopped over a year ago. At the hearing, 
he also provided IRS account transcripts for 2008 and 2009 that showed he had been 
consistently  making  monthly  payments  of  $375  since  August  2012.  As  of  September 
2015,  his  IRS  account  balance  for  2008  was  $3,961  and  for  2009  was  $17,124.  The 
account transcripts showed that his IRS debt had been cut almost in half.9 

  
Besides the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant’s credit report dated March 26, 
2015, reflected that he had no other delinquent debts. He also testified that he had no 
other delinquent debts. In 2014, he earned about $108,000 and his wife earned about 
$25,000. In his post-hearing submission, Applicant presented letters from the state that 
reflected he did not have an outstanding tax liability for 2008 and 2009.10

Policies 

 

The  President  of  the  United  States  has  the  authority  to  control  access  to 
information  bearing  on  national  security  and  to  determine  whether  an  individual  is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  527  (1988).  The  President  has  authorized  the  Secretary  of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified  Information  within  Industry  §  2  (Feb.  20,  1960),  as  amended.  The  U.S. 
Supreme  Court  has  recognized  the  substantial  discretion  of  the  Executive  Branch  in 
regulating  access  to  information  pertaining  to  national  security,  emphasizing  that  “no 
one  has  a  ‘right’  to  a  security  clearance.”  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 

 
Eligibility  for  a  security  clearance  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the 
criteria  contained  in  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  AGs  are  not  inflexible  rules  of 
law.  Instead,  recognizing  the  complexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  An  administrative 
judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, in reaching a decision.  

 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard 
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible 
extrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or.  10865  §  7.  See  also  Executive  Order  12968  (Aug.  2,  1995),  Section  3.  Thus,  a 
clearance  decision  is  merely  an  indication  that  the  Applicant  has  or  has  not  met  the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 

 
Initially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in 
the  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).

Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.”  ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  19,  2002).  The  burden  of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   

Analysis 

 

 

Guideline F, Financial Considerations 

 
The security concern for this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18 as follows: 

 

Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet 
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or 
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise 
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to 
protect  classified 
financially 
overextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 

information.  An 

individual  who 

is 

AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   

 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  

(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  

 
 
 
 
 
The  evidence  established  that  Applicant  accumulated  delinquent  debts  that  he 
was unable or unwilling to pay for an extended period. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply in 
this case. 
 
 
applicable:  
 

Four financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 

(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred 
under  such  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast 
doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good 
judgment; 
 
(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely 
beyond  the  person’s  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business 
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 

 
5 
 
 

(c)  the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the  problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.  
 
Applicant  incurred  delinquent  debts  because  he  continued  to  receive  disability 
benefits  after  his  income  exceeded  earning  limitations  and  because  he  failed  to  pay 
taxes  on  income  earned  in  2008  and  2009.  These  events  do  not  constitute 
circumstances beyond his control. AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. 

 
Applicant  has  resolved  the  state  tax  lien  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  the  disability 
overpayment  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  He  has  established  a  repayment  plan  to  resolve  the 
delinquent  federal  taxes  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  He  has  been  consistently  making  payments 
under  that  plan  for  the  past  three  years.  The  record  established  that  his  financial 
problems  are  under  control  and  are  being  resolved.  He  has  not  incurred  any  recent 
delinquent debts. His financial problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on 
his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) 
apply. 

 

Whole-Person Concept 

In  the  adjudication  process,  an  administrative  judge  must  carefully  weigh  a 
number  of  variables  known  as  the  whole-person  concept.  Available  information  about 
the applicant as well as the factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a) should be considered in reaching 
a  determination.11  In  this  case,  I  gave  due  consideration  to  the  information  about 
Applicant in the record and concluded the favorable information, including the mitigating 
evidence,  outweigh  the  security  concerns  at  issue.  Applicant  met  his  burden  of 
persuasion to mitigate the security concerns.  

Formal findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive 

are:          

Formal Findings 

 

                                                           

11 The adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a) are as follows:  

(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct,  to  include  knowledgeable  participation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the 
conduct;  (4)  the  individual’s  age  and  maturity  at  the  time  of  the  conduct;  (5)  the  extent  to 
which  participation  is  voluntary;  (6)  the  presence  or  absence  of  rehabilitation  and  other 
permanent  behavioral  changes;  (7)  the  motivation  for  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for 
pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or  duress;  and  (9)  the  likelihood  of  continuation  or 
recurrence.

MARSHALL, Jr., Arthur E., Administrative Judge: 

 
                                        Statement of the Case 
 
On  April  4,  2014,  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  issued  Applicant  a 
Statement  of  Reasons  (SOR)  detailing  security  concerns  under  Guideline  B  (Foreign 
Influence) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).1 In a response signed April 28, 2014, 
Applicant admitted all allegations and requested a hearing based on the written record. 
On August 20, 2015, the Government prepared a file of relevant material (FORM) which 
included  nine  attachments  (“Items”).  Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM.  I  was 
assigned the case on December 1, 2015. Based on a thorough review of the case file, I 
find that Applicant failed to carry his burden in mitigating security concerns arising under 
both Guideline B and Guideline E.  

     Findings of Fact 

 
Applicant  is  a  71-year-old  man  who  is  presently  not  working  while  his  security 
clearance is updated. He has earned a high school diploma. He was divorced in 1998 
                                                           
1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security  Clearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006.

and is now estranged from a subsequent spouse. Facts about this estranged female are 
unclear,  although  it  appears  she  is  from  Russia,  where  she  currently  resides  with  or 
near  family.  He  provided  incomplete  information  on  his  security  clearance  application 
(SCA)  about  his  family  and  children.  Other  discrepancies  appear  throughout  his 
investigatory record. Applicant presently lives in another country with a female foreign 
national  in  order  to  reduce  the  costs  he  would  otherwise  expend  living  in  the  United 
States while awaiting a return to work.  
 
 
At issue in the SOR are the following facts: Applicant has a wife who is a citizen 
and resident of Russia.2 They are estranged, but Applicant has no plans to divorce his 
foreign  wife  because  he  no  longer  believes  in  divorce.  He  has  a  daughter  who  is  a 
citizen  of  the  United  States  and  is  currently  a  resident  of  Russia,  where  she  is  a 
university student. He also has parents-in-law who are citizens and residents of Russia. 
Applicant met them in about July 1998 on a visit to their home. He again saw them on a 
subsequent  trip  to  Russia  with  his  wife.  He  has  had  no  other  contact  with  them  and 
does not know how often his estranged wife currently has with her parents now that all 
three  are  in  Russia.  His  father-in-law  and  mother-in-law  are  a  teacher  and  a 
gynecologist,  respectively.  Applicant  assumed  they  were  Communists  because  the 
Communists were in power when he met them. As of 2015, Russia is one of the two 
leading state intelligence threats to United States interests, based on their capabilities, 
intent,  and  broad  operational  scopes.3  Applicant  admits  the  Guideline  B  SOR 
allegations, but did not address them in any manner in his SOR Response.     
 
 
In completing SCAs in both August 3, 2009, and March 23, 2013, Applicant failed 
to  list  multiple  names  he  has  used,  places  of  former  residence,  periods  of 
unemployment, relatives, and foreign contacts. He told an investigator in 2010 that he 
had no problems while working with a particular employer, but later conceded he was 
involved in a harassment suit while working there. Despite a 2010 claim to the contrary, 
he failed in 2007 to file an appropriate contact with foreign nationals report regarding the 
foreign woman with whom he currently cohabitates. Applicant admits these allegations.  
 

 

Policies 

 

 
 
 

When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability 

 
 
the 
administrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  used  in  evaluating  an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 

for  a  security  clearance, 

These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the 
complexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the 
                                                           
2  In  some  records  within  the  FORM,  Applicant  indicated  that  his  estranged  wife  became  a  naturalized 
citizen in 2007 or 2008 and now resides in the United States, but the discrepancies are never resolved.

factors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching 
adjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available, 
reliable information about the person in making a decision. 

 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to 
classified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  

 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel  and  has  the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  

the  Government  predicated  upon 

 
A  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary 
relationship  with 
trust  and  confidence.  This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard 
classified information. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall 
be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b).  

The security concern relating to the Guideline B is set out in AG ¶ 6: 

Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual 
has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or 
induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a 
way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by 
any  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should 
consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or 
financial 
to,  such

Guideline B, Foreign Influence 
 

 

Applicant remains married to the female of Russian origin at issue. Therefore, it 
can be assumed he maintains some level of affection for this woman, the mother of his 
child. It can also be assumed he maintains a bond or ties of affection for their child, who 
is  now  studying  at  a  Russian  college.  As  for  his  in-laws,  while  their  contact  with 
Applicant is negligible, it can be assumed his estranged partner has ties of affection with 
her own parents. Those ties are routinely attributed to the spouse (Applicant) in these 
cases. Given these facts, disqualifying conditions AG ¶¶ 7(a) and (b) apply:  
 

to  protect  sensitive 

AG ¶ 7(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional 
associate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or  resident  in  a 
foreign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign 
exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and

that  create  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  between  the  individual’s

that information. 
 
In  finding  disqualifying  conditions  applicable,  I  specifically  note  that  AG  ¶  7(a) 
requires substantial evidence of a heightened risk. The heightened risk required to raise 
a  disqualifying  condition  is  a  relatively  low  standard.  Heightened  risk  denotes  a  risk 
greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a foreign 
government or substantial assets in a foreign nation. Russia is one of the two leading 
state intelligence threats to United States interests. In addition, foreign family ties can 
pose a security risk even without a connection to a foreign government. This is because 
an applicant may be subject to coercion or undue influence when a third party pressures 
or  threatens  an  applicant’s family  members.  Under  these facts,  while  unlikely,  a  third 
party  coercion  concern  potentially  exists  in  Russia.  Therefore,  there  is  sufficient 
evidence to raise the above disqualifying conditions.

technology  and 

  
AG ¶ 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all 

of the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 8, and find the following are relevant: 
 

AG ¶ 8(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in 
which  these  persons  are  located,  or  the  positions  or  activities  of  those 
persons  in  that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be 
placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign 
individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; 
and 

 

AG  ¶  8(b)  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual’s 
sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or 
country  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such  deep  and  longstanding 
relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to 
resolve any conflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests.

The mere possession of close family ties to persons in a foreign country is not, 
as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in 
a foreign country and an applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, 
this  factor  alone  is  sufficient  to  create  the  potential  for  foreign  influence  and  could 
potentially result in the compromise of classified information.  

 
Here,  Applicant  provided  scant  information about  his estranged  wife,  daughter, 
and  in-laws.  Indeed,  information  about  his  in-laws  is  more  abundant  than  information 
about his child and her mother. While his personal ties to his in-laws may be weak, their 
impact on Applicant cannot be discerned without more information about his wife and 
child. Under these limited facts, no mitigating conditions weigh in Applicant’s favor. 

The  security  concern  for  personal  conduct  is  set  out  in  AG  ¶  15,  where  the 
significance of conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  is  defined  ([p]ersonal  conduct  can 
raise  questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect 
classified  information).  Of  special  interest  is  any  failure to  provide  truthful and  candid 
answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the 
security clearance process.  

 
In completing his 2009 and 2013 SCAs, Applicant’s answers in many areas were 
either deficient or in conflict. His answers in a 2010 interview were either intentionally or 
negligently incomplete  with regard to past  workplace problems and the reporting of a 
foreign  cohabitant  to  his  former  employer.  If  these  inaccuracies  were  intentionally 
incorrect, such facts could give rise to:  

 
AG  ¶  16(a)  deliberate  omission,  concealment,  or  falsification  of  relevant 
facts 
from  any  personnel  security  questionnaire,  personal  history 
statement,  or  similar  form  used  to  conduct  investigations,  determine 
employment  qualifications,  award  benefits  or  status,  determine  security 
clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, 
and  
 
AG  ¶  16(b)  deliberately  providing 
information 
concerning  relevant  facts  to  an  employer,  investigator,  security  official, 
competent medical authority, or other official government representative. 
 
Applicant admitted all three allegations raised under Guideline E and provided no 
explanations or commentary. While his admission to the SCA discrepancies could be 
discounted and his discrepancies found to be the product of negligence, this guideline 
could  be  found  in  his  favor.  In  admitting  allegations  that  he  knowingly  withheld 
information and denied having had problems while employed at a place where he was 
involved in a harassment suit, however, the facts tend to indicate that these answers – 
without  more  –  were  intentionally  false  or  misleading.  This  is  particularly  true  in  the 
5 

false  or  misleading 

 

Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 

 

 
 
 

absence  of  some  explanation  claiming  forgetfulness  or  another  basis  for  having 
provided a negligently entered SCA answer. Therefore, given his admissions, none of 
the mitigating conditions at AG ¶ 17(a) – (g) apply.  

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 
Under  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a). Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
 
Applicant failed to do more than admit the allegations raised in the SOR. He then 
requested a judgment based on the written record. It is that very record that is full of 
discrepancies  and  contradictions  that  contributed  to  the  security  concerns  at  issue. 
There  are  simply  insufficient  facts  to  evaluate  Applicant’s  foreign  kin,  the  SCA  and 
interview inaccuracies, or even the Applicant as an individual. This is simply the result of 
a  deficiently  supplemented  record.  Without  more,  there  is  insufficient  information  to 
rebut, refute, or mitigate the security concerns raised under the foreign influence and 
personal conduct guidelines.

HOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: 

 
On  April  9,  2011,  Applicant  submitted  his  Electronic  Questionnaires  for 
Investigations  Processing  (e-QIP).  On  November  3,  2014,  the  Department  of  Defense 
Consolidated  Adjudications  Facility  (DODCAF)  issued  Applicant  a  Statement  of 
Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The  action was 
taken  under  Executive  Order  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information  Within 
Industry  (February  20,  1960),  as  amended;  Department  of  Defense  Directive  5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)  effective  within  the 
Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  

 
Applicant  answered  the  SOR  in  writing  on  December  8,  2014.  Applicant 

requested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  

 
On April 17, 2015, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written case. 
A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 to 7, was 

 
1 
 
 

provided  to  the  Applicant  on  August  5,  2015.  He  was  given  the  opportunity  to  file 
objections  and  submit  material  in  refutation,  extenuation,  or  mitigation.  Applicant 
received the FORM on September 14, 2015.  

 
Applicant  did  not  file  a  Response  to  the  FORM  within  the  30  day  time  allowed 

that would have expired on October 14, 2015.  

 
I  received  the  case assignment on  November  5,  2015. Based  upon  a  review  of 

the pleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 

 

Findings of Fact 

 

Applicant admitted   allegations in Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.g , then fails to admit 
or deny 1.h, and 1i., then admits and disputes 1.j to 1.m, and fails to admit or deny 1.n 
to 1.q. in Paragraph 1 concerning financial debts. He admitted the 10 allegations under 
Paragraph  2  alleging  20  personal  conduct  security  violations.  He  further  stated  in  his 
Answer  that  Subparagraphs  1.d  to  1.h  were  ”investigated  by  management”  without 
disclosing the results of those investigations. (Items 1-7)  

 
Applicant  is  35  years  old,  married  having  been  previously  divorced,  and  has 
three children and one stepchild. He works as a security guard for a defense contractor. 
Applicant served in the U.S. Marines from 1998 to 2002. (Items 2-4) 
 
 
Applicant  owes  $129,524  for  these  17  delinquent  debts.  His  Answer  states  he 
paid  five  debts  (Subparagraphs  1.c,  1.e,  1.h,  1.i,  1.o),  has  installment  agreements  for 
six other debts (Subparagraphs 1.a, 1b, 1.d, 1.g, 1.n, 1.p, and 1.q), and is disputing four 
other  debts  (Subparagraphs  1.j  to  1.m).  The  debt  to  an  insurance  company  in 
Subparagraph 1.f he simply admits with no other explanation. The earliest debt is dated 
in 2004.  (Items 1-7) 
 
 
Applicant’s  Personal  Financial  Statement  submitted  with  his  interrogatory 
answers  states  his  2004  divorce  and  physical  injury  in  2010  caused  his  financial 
difficulties, but they are  “turning around” now. Applicant did not submit any documents 
to support his SOR answers that debts are paid or being paid on the installment basis. 
He did not submit any dispute letters on other debts. He did not respond to the FORM. 
(Items 1-7) 
 
 
Applicant has numerous violations on his work record for his employer, for whom 
he has worked since 2004. Applicant had non-medical call-offs between 2004 and 2013, 
tardiness in the same time, and several counseling sessions. The counseling pertained 
to  his  possession  of  a  personal  cell  phone  at  the  work  site,  conducting  personal 
business on a government telephone, having a beverage at the work site, failing to sign 
in after a meal break, failure to maintain his uniform, failure to execute his duties when 
he did not take a key inventory, failure to sign a schedule receipt for four hours of hold 
over work he performed, failure to park a work vehicle in the correct location for which a 

 

2 
 
 
 
 

parking ticket was issued to his employer, failure to sign into work, failure to hand carry 
a  package  to  the  addressee  that  resulted  in  a  processing  delay,  and  allowing  an 
unauthorized  vehicle  to  gain  access  to  a  facility  without  properly  obtaining  valid 
identification  from  the  driver  and  vehicle  inspection  in  December  2006.  Applicant 
received  a  letter  of  suspension  in  May  2006.  In  October  2006  he  received  a  two  day 
suspension.  In  December  2006  termination  was  started,  in  September  2011  Applicant 
was suspended for two days after having a cell phone at the work site, and in February 
2012  he  received  a  one  day  suspension for  being  tardy  for  work  four  times.  Applicant 
admitted  all  these  violations  with  the  notation  on  the  disciplinary  accusations  that 
“management investigated” them. (Items 1-7) 
 
 
Applicant’s file contains several hundred pages of documents listing his violations 
as  alleged  in  the  SOR  and  the  disciplinary  action  taken  by  his  employer.  These 
documents support each SOR allegation. (Item 4) 
  

     Applicant  did  not  submit  any  documentation  that  he  has  participated  in  credit 
counseling or budget education. He provided no evidence concerning the quality of his 
job  performance.  He  submitted  no  character  references  or  other  evidence  tending  to 
establish  good  judgment,  trustworthiness,  or  reliability.  I  was  unable  to  evaluate  his 
credibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his case decided 
without a hearing. 
 

Policies 

 

When  evaluating  an  applicant=s  suitability 

the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially 
disqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  useful  in  evaluating  an 
applicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. 

for  a  security  clearance, 

 
These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the 
complexities  of  human  behavior,  the  administrative  judge  applies  the  guidelines  in 
conjunction  with  the  factors  listed  in  AG  ¶  2  describing  the  adjudicative  process.  The

The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) 
requires  that  A[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to 
classified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.@  In  reaching  this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record.

According  to  Directive  &  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to 
establish  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  &  E3.1.15,  an 
“applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, 
and  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  as  to  obtaining  a  favorable  clearance 
decision.”  

the  Government  predicated  upon 

 
A  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary 
relationship  with 
trust  and  confidence.  This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or 
safeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally 
permissible  extrapolation  as  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of 
classified information. See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 

Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 

Analysis 

 

The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 

out in AG & 18:       
 

Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one=s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet 
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or 
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise 
questions  about  an  individual=s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to 
protect  classified

information.  An 

individual  who 

is 

 

The guideline at AG & 19 contains nine disqualifying conditions that could raise 
security concerns. From these nine conditions, two conditions are applicable to the facts 
found in this case: 

 

 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 
From  2004  to  the  present,  Applicant  accumulated  17  delinquent  debts,  totaling 
$129,524 that remain unpaid or unresolved. Applicant has not shown clearly what debts 
he paid or is paying beyond his mere statements in his Answer. Without supporting and 
well-organized  documentation  addressing  each  of  the  allegations  specifically  the  true 

 

4 
 
 
 
 

 
status of his debts cannot be known. An in-depth review of the Items in the file shows 
no support for his alleged payments.  
 

The  guideline  in  AG  ¶  20  contains  six  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security 
concerns  arising  from  financial  difficulties.  Only  one  mitigating  condition  might  have 
partial applicability. 

 

(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely 
beyond  the  person's  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business 
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. 

 

AG ¶ 20 (b) would apply if his divorce 11 years ago adversely affected his ability 
to repay his debts. But he also has to act responsibly under the circumstances. It is his 
burden  of  proof  to  submit  specific  documents  to  demonstrate  those  actions.  However, 
he failed to meet his burden of proof on that issue.  

 
Lastly,  Applicant  contends  his  medical  problem  in  2010  caused  some  of  his 
delinquent debt. Applicant failed to prove AG ¶ 20 (b) applied because he did not submit 
sufficient evidence of the conditions that he asserted were beyond his control and that 
he  acted  responsibly  in  resolving  his  delinquent  debts  during  the  time  the  debts  were 
accumulating. 

 

Guideline E, Personal Conduct 

 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or 
unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise  questions 
about  an  individual's  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect 
classified  information.  Of  special  interest  is  any  failure  to  provide  truthful 
and  candid  answers  during  the  security  clearance  process  or  any  other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG  ¶  16  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security  concern  and  may  be 

disqualifying: 

 
 (c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is 
not  sufficient  for  an  adverse  determination  under  any  other  single 
guideline,  but  which,  when  considered  as  a  whole,  supports  a  whole-
person  assessment  of  questionable 
judgment,  untrustworthiness, 
unreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and 
regulations,  or  other  characteristics  indicating  that  the  person  may  not 
properly safeguard protected information; 

 

5 
 
 
 
 

 

(d)  credible  adverse  information  that  is  not  explicitly  covered  under  any 
other  guideline  and  may  not  be  sufficient  by  itself  for  an  adverse 
determination,  but  which,  when  combined  with  all  available  information 
supports  a  whole-person  assessment  of  questionable 
judgment, 
untrustworthiness,  unreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to  comply 
with  rules  and  regulations,  or  other  characteristics  indicating  that  the 
person  may  not  properly  safeguard  protected  information.  This  includes 
but is not limited to consideration of: 
 

(1)  untrustworthy  or  unreliable  behavior  to  include  breach  of  client 
confidentiality,  release  of  proprietary  information, unauthorized  release of 
sensitive corporate or other government protected information: 
 

(2)  disruptive,  violent,  or  other  inappropriate  behavior  in  the 

workplace;  
 

(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;  

 

(4)  evidence  of  significant  misuse  of  Government  or  other 

employer's time or resources; and 
 
(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, 
that  creates  a  vulnerability  to  exploitation,  manipulation,  or  duress,  such 
as  (1)  engaging  in  activities  which,  if  known,  may  affect  the  person's 
personal,  professional,  or  community  standing,  or  (2)  while  in  another 
country,  engaging  in  any  activity  that  is  illegal  in  that  country  or  that  is 
legal  in  that  country  but  illegal  in  the  United  States  and  may  serve  as  a 
basis  for  exploitation  or  pressure  by  the  foreign  security  or  intelligence 
service or other group; 
 
Applicant  committed  numerous  acts  of  inappropriate  conduct  in  the  work  place, 
exhibited  a pattern of dishonesty  and  rule  violations,  and  misused  his  employer’s  time 
and resources to a significant degree, as shown by the continuing pattern of misconduct 
from  2004  to  2014.  AG  ¶  16  (c)  and  (d)  apply  to  the  totality  of  Applicant’s  repeated 
violations and failure to conform his behavior to expected standards of conduct.  

 
Applicant’s  personal  conduct,  which  consists  of  a  number  repeated  and 
significant  violations  of  company  policies,  creates  a  vulnerability  to  exploitation, 
manipulation, or duress because of the frequency and nature of the incidents. Coupled 
with his financial debts, Applicant is especially vulnerable to coercion and duress in the 
hope of extricating himself from his predicament caused by his misconduct and financial 
delinquencies. AG ¶ 16 (e) is established.  

 

 

6 
 
 
 
 

 

AG  ¶  17  provides  seven  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security  concerns.  A 
review of each shows that none apply in this Applicant’s case. His offenses are a series 
of  transgressions  that  show  an  inattention  to  the  requirements  of  his  position,  casting 
doubt  on  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  good  judgment.  AG  ¶  17  (c)  is  not 
established.  
 

Applicant has not acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change 
his actions or taken other positive steps to show his course of conduct will not recur. AG 
¶ 17 (d) does not apply.  
 

Applicant  has  not  taken  positive  action  to  reduce  or  eliminate  vulnerability  to 

exploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG ¶ 17 (e) is not established.  
 

The information is substantiated in many documents submitted in the Applicant’s 

file. AG ¶ 17 (f) is not established.  
 

Finally, there is no allegation that Applicant associated with persons involved with 
criminal  activity,  so  AG  ¶17  (g)  is  not  applicable.  Nor  are  the  first  two  mitigating 
conditions of any applicability because they apply to false statements by any Applicant 
or failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 

 
Under  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an 
applicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s 
conduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a): 

the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of 
to 

 
the 
the  conduct;  (2) 
(1) 
circumstances  surrounding 
include  knowledgeable 
participation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the 
individual=s  age  and  maturity  at  the  time  of  the  conduct;  (5)  the extent to 
which  participation 
the  presence  or  absence  of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

Under AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      

 

I  considered  the  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  in  light  of  all 
facts  and  circumstances  surrounding  this  case.  Applicant  was  an  adult  when  he 
incurred  the  debts.  He  has  not  taken  any  action  supported  by  objective  evidence  to 

 

7 
 
 
 
 

 
resolve his delinquent debts. This inaction leaves him vulnerable to pressure, coercion, 
exploitation,  or  duress  based  on  the  magnitude  of  his  financial  obligation.  His  lack  of 
action continues to this day, and is obviously voluntary. His inaction will continue based 
on  his  past  performance.  Applicant  displayed  a  lack  of  good  judgment  incurring  the 
debts.  Next,  he  exhibited  a  continued  lack  of  appropriate  judgment  by  failing  to  make 
payments on any of his delinquent debts during the past seven years. 

 
Applicant also has a pattern of violations of work standards set by his employer. 
He is an inattentive employee who finds it difficult to conform his behavior to the rules 
and regulations of his employer. His misconduct has been perpetrated over a decade of 
employment. 

 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or substantial doubts as to 
Applicant=s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a  security  clearance.  For  all  these  reasons,  I 
conclude  Applicant  did  not  mitigate  the  security  concerns  arising  under  the  guidelines 
for Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct.

COACHER, Robert E., Administrative Judge: 

 
Applicant has not mitigated the alcohol consumption security concerns. Eligibility 

for access to classified information is denied.  

Statement of the Case 

On  June  16,  2015,  the  Department  of  Defense  Consolidated  Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security 
concerns  under  Guideline  G,  alcohol  consumption.  DOD  CAF  acted  under  Executive 
Order  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information  within  Industry  (February  20, 
1960),  as  amended;  DOD  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security 
Clearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. 

 
Applicant  answered  the  SOR  on  July  14,  2015,  and  elected  to  have  his  case 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the 
Government’s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 9, 2015. The evidence

included in the FORM is identified as Items 4-10 and is admitted into the record (Items 
1-3 are pleadings and transmittal documents). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who 
received it on October 19, 2015. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections 
and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted an undated 
response to the FORM, which was admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibit (AE) 
A. The case was assigned to me on December 21, 2015.  

In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all but one of the allegations. The 
admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and 
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.1 

 
Applicant is 56 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since 1997. He 
is divorced and has three children, ages 15, 18, and 20. He has a bachelor’s degree. He 
has no military experience.2  
 
 
 
Applicant’s conduct raised in the SOR included: a history of consuming alcohol, 
at times, to excess from 1974 to about April 2014; being found guilty for operating under 
the  influence  of  alcohol  (OUI)  in  February  1991;  being  found  guilty  for  OUI  2nd  in 
November 1997; and being found guilty for OUI 3rd in November 2010 (See SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
- 1.d).3 
 
 
Applicant  began  drinking  alcohol  when  he  was  approximately  15  years  old  in 
1974. He drinks beer on most occasions. Even after his OUI convictions, he stated he 
was  still  was  consuming  two  to  three  beers  a  week.  He  drinks  in  social  settings  and 
after hockey games. As a result of his 2010 OUI conviction, he lost his driver’s license 
for five years. He completed his probation in May 2015.4 
 
 
Court documents establish that Applicant was found guilty of three OUI offenses, 
in 1992 (1991 arrest), 2000 (1997 arrest), and 2012 (2010 arrest). He was placed on 
probation in each instance.5 
 
 
In  February  1991,  Applicant  was  driving  home  from  a  friend’s  house  where  he 
consumed  about  four  beers.  He  was  stopped  by  a  police  officer  who  had  observed 
Applicant’s  car  cross  over  the  center  line.  Applicant  was  given,  and  failed,  a  field 
sobriety test. He was taken into the police station where he refused a breathalyzer test.

Findings of Fact 

 

 

 
2 
 
 

He was charged with OUI and later pleaded guilty. He was required to attend 12 weeks 
of alcohol education and counseling classes, which he completed.6 
 
 
In November 1997, Applicant was going home from a high school football game 
when he was stopped in traffic by a police officer. Applicant had two beers before the 
game  and  shared  a  flask  containing  some  kind  of  alcohol  at  the  game.  The  officer 
apparently  asked  Applicant 
if  he  had  been  drinking  and  Applicant  answered 
affirmatively. He was then given field sobriety tests, which he failed. He was arrested, 
taken back to the police station and given a breathalyzer test, which he also failed. He 
was  found  guilty  of  OUI  and  sentenced  to  two  years’  probation,  loss  of  his  driver’s 
license  for  six  months,  and  12  weeks  required  attendance  at  alcohol  education  and 
counseling classes.7 
 
 
In  November  2010,  Applicant  was  driving  back  from  a  hockey  tournament  and 
was stopped by a state patrolman because he crossed the center line. Applicant had 
consumed six beers and shared a flask of whiskey at the hockey tournament. He failed 
the  field  sobriety  tests  and  was  almost  incoherent  to  the  patrolman.  He  was  arrested 
and taken to a police station where he was offered a breathalyzer test. He was unable 
to properly perform the test, which was deemed a refusal to take the test. He was found 
guilty of OUI and sentenced to six months’ incarceration, five years of probation, loss of 
driver’s  license  for  five  years,  and  mandatory  substance  abuse  evaluation  and 
treatment.8 
 
The court-ordered substance abuse treatment involved two mandatory sessions 
 
and  Applicant  voluntarily  attended  six  more  sessions.  He 
to  provide 
documentation of any evaluation done by the counselors, but Applicant stated he was 
diagnosed  as  being  an  alcohol  abuser.  Applicant  also  attended  Alcohol  Anonymous 
(AA) meetings once every six to eight weeks. He last attended an AA meeting in May 
2015. He continued to drink an occasional beer every few months. In May 2015, at an 
AA meeting he heard a story had made him decide to stop drinking alcohol entirely. He 
claims he has not had any alcohol since that time.9

When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability 

 
the 
administrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  used  in  evaluating  an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.

Policies

These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the 
complexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the 
factors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching 
adjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 

 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to 
classified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  

 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel,  and  has  the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.”  

the  Government  predicated  upon 

 
A  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary 
relationship  with 
trust  and  confidence.  This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the  possible  risk  that  an  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard 
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible 
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified 
information. 

 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall  in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  

Analysis 

 

 

Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption 

AG ¶ 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: 

Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable 
judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about 
an individual's reliability and trustworthiness. 

 
4 
 
 

AG  ¶  22  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security  concern  and  may  be 

disqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: 

(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under 
the  influence,  fighting,  child  or  spouse  abuse,  disturbing  the  peace,  or 
other  incidents  of  concern,  regardless  of  whether  the  individual  is 
diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;  

(c)  habitual  or  binge  consumption  of  alcohol  to  the  point  of  impaired 
judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol 
abuser or alcohol dependent. 

 
 

 
 
of both disqualifying conditions.  

Applicant’s three OUI convictions and his drinking history support the application 

I  have  also  considered  all  of  the  mitigating  conditions  for  alcohol  consumption 

under AG ¶ 23 and found the following relevant: 

(a)  so  much  time  has  passed,  or  the  behavior  was  so  infrequent,  or  it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or 
does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment; and 

(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol 
abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and 
has  established  a  pattern  of  abstinence  (if  alcohol  dependent)  or 
responsible use (if an alcohol abuser). 

 
Applicant’s  last  adverse  alcohol  incident  occurred  in  November  2010  and  he 
came  off  probation  for  that  offense  in  May  2015.  His  three  OUI  convictions  are  not 
infrequent  under  these  circumstances.  Insufficient  attenuation  exists  to  conclude 
enough  time  has  passed  since  his  last  alcohol-related  incident.  His  history  of  OUI 
arrests  and  convictions  under  similar  circumstances  suggest  that  recurrence  is  a 
possibility. His current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment are in doubt. AG ¶ 
23(a) does not apply. 
 
Applicant recently decided to totally abstain from using alcohol. He indicated that 
 
he has abstained since May 2015. While this is a commendable start, it is too soon to 
determine whether his abstinence will continue to be part of his life or whether he will 
use alcohol responsibly in the future. AG ¶ 23(b) partially applies.   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an 
 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 

 
5 
 
 

conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 

the  conduct, 

the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of 
to 

(1) 
the  conduct;  (2) 
the 
circumstances  surrounding 
include  knowledgeable 
participation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which  participation 
the  presence  or  absence  of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 

is  voluntary;  (6) 

Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guideline and the whole-person concept.        

I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the circumstances that 
led  to  his  arrests  and  his  current  state  of  abstinence.  Overall,  the  record  evidence 
leaves  me  with  questions  and  doubts  as  to  Applicant’s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a 
security  clearance.  For  all  these  reasons,  I  conclude  Applicant  failed  to  mitigate  the 
security concerns under Guideline G.

DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 

 
Applicant  failed  to  mitigate  the  security  concerns  arising  under  Guideline  K 
(handling  protected  information)  and  Guideline  E  (personal  conduct).  Clearance  is 
denied. 

Statement of the Case 

On  February  13,  2015,  the  Department  of  Defense  Consolidated  Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security 
concerns  under  Guidelines  K  and  E.  This  action  was  taken  under  Executive  Order 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, 
as  amended;  Department  of  Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. 

 
The SOR detailed reasons why DOD CAF could not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s security 
clearance.  In  an  undated  document,  Applicant  answered  the  SOR.  The  case  was 

assigned to me on January 8, 2016. DOHA issued the Notice of Hearing on January 29, 
2016. The hearing was held as scheduled on February 22, 2016.  

 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 
7,  while  Applicant  testified  and  offered  no  exhibits.  After  the  hearing,  he  submitted 
documents that were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F. All exhibits were 
admitted  into  evidence  without  objection.  The  transcript  (Tr.)  of  the  hearing  was 
received on March 1, 2016. 

Procedural Matter 

 
Department Counsel moved to amend SOR ¶ 1.c by changing the listed month 
from  May  to  April.  Applicant  had  no  objection  to  the  amendment.  The  motion  was 
granted.1 

 

 

Findings of Fact 

 
Applicant is a 33-year-old security guard who is being sponsored for a security 
clearance  by  a  federal  contractor.  He  first  began  working  for  that  contractor  in  about 
February  2010,  but  subsequently  has  been  employed  by  other  companies.  He 
graduated  from  high  school  in  2002,  attended  college  without  earning  a  degree,  and 
qualified as an emergency medical technician (EMT). From 2002 to 2008, he served in 
the  Army  National  Guard,  achieved  the  grade  of  specialist  (E-4),  and  received  an 
honorable discharge. He deployed to Iraq from January 2007 to February 2008. He is 
divorced  and  has  a  child  who  is  nine  years  old.  He  was  first  granted  a  security 
clearance in 2004.2 
 

The  SOR  alleged  under  Guideline  K  that  Applicant  committed  three  security 
violations in 2010 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c). Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged the he was 
charged with assault on a family member in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.a); that he was terminated 
from a job during a probationary period in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.b); that he was counseled for 
neglect of duty and falsification in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.c); that he illegally gained access to a 
hotel in 2009 (SOR ¶ 2.d); that he was returned early from an overseas assignment and 
placed  on  probation  in  2010  (SOR  2.e);  and  that  he  falsified  his  responses  to  two 
questions in an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SOR ¶¶ 
2.f and 2.g). The allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c were also cross-alleged under Guideline 
E in a single allegation (SOR ¶ 2.h). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the 
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 2.a-2.e, did not respond to the allegation in SOR ¶ 
2.h, and denied the remaining allegations.3

SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c,  2.e,  and  2.h  –  three  security  violations  in  a  two-month 
period,  being  returned  from  an  overseas  assignment  without  completing  a 
contract,  and  being  placed  on  probation  in  2010.  From  March  to  April  2010, 
Applicant worked as a security guard for a company [hereafter referred to as “Company 
A”]  at  an  overseas  location.  In  that  job,  his  duties  included  verifying  the  eligibility  of 
those seeking access to controlled spaces and classified information. 

 
On March 1, 2010, a team leader at Company A issued a memorandum for the 
record (MFR) that reflected Applicant closed, but did not lock, a safe in a secured space 
and failed to record properly the opening and closing of the safe and the logging in and 
out of classified documents. (Allegation in SOR 1.a). Applicant was counseled to ensure 
that  all  procedures  were  followed,  especially  those  concerning  the  safeguarding  of 
classified 
instances  of  unsatisfactory 
performance  would  result  in  more  severe  corrective  action.  The  MFR  reflected  it  was 
placed in “personnel file,” but it does not contain Applicant’s signature or any indication 
that he was shown it or informed about it.4 

information,  and  admonished 

that 

further 

 
Applicant testified that he never willfully violated any security protocol that was 
properly  explained  to  him.  This  incident  occurred  soon  after  he  began  working  for 
Company A. He arrived at the overseas location less than 48 hours before the incident. 
It happened his first day on the job. He claimed that he was not given proper guidance 
on the opening and closing of the safe. The safe was not secure because he failed to 
spin the lock dial. The safe was located in a secure room and the classified information 
was not subject to compromise. Additionally, a person cleared for classified information 
signed out a document, but Applicant did not know there was a part of the document 
that he was required to fill out. He acknowledged that he made mistakes because he did 
not ask enough questions and stated he did not thereafter make those same mistakes 
again.5 
 
On March 10, 2010, a team leader at Company A issued a MFR that reflected 
Applicant failed to follow orders by permitting a non-cleared worker to have access to 
the controlled access area (CAA) without verifying the worker was on the CAA access 
roster. (Allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant was questioned about this security violation 
and  stated  that  he  recognized  the  worker.  The  MFR  noted  that  the  worker  had  just 
returned from a leave of absence and had not yet been placed back on the CAA access 
roster.  The  MFR  also  indicated  that  it  would  serve  as  a  written  reprimand  of 
unsatisfactory performance. The MFR reflected it was placed in “personnel file,” but it 
does  not  contain  Applicant’s  signature  or  any  indication  that  he  was  shown  it  or 
informed about it.6

Applicant testified that this was his second day working at a particular post. He 
stated  that  he  read  the  wrong  weekly  CAA  access  roster  at  the  post  and  the  non-
cleared worker was listed on that roster. This was an outdated access roster. Applicant 
claimed  that,  due  to  a  clerical  error,  the  individual  was  not  added  to  the  most  recent 
access roster. He claimed he recognized the individual as being a person on the access 
roster from the previous day, but that was the wrong access roster. When the error was 
discovered,  the  old  roster  was  taken  away  and  a  new  roster  was  issued  with  the 
individual in question added to it. Applicant stated his team leader  was upset that he 
had not checked the latest access roster. He was counseled for this incident, but did not 
remember receiving a written warning at that time.7 

 
On  April  19,  2010,  a  team  leader  at  Company  A  issued  a  MFR  that  reflected 
Applicant failed to conduct properly a page inventory of classified documents on April 
17,  2010.  (Allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.c).  The  MFR  noted  that  two  of  the  documents  had 
been  previously  combined  and  another  had  48  pages  removed  for  destruction. 
Applicant’s  inventory  failed  to  account  for  the  missing  pages.  He  was  asked  how  he 
conducted the inventory and responded by saying he conducted a page-by-page count. 
When asked to explain the discrepancy involving the missing pages, he acknowledged 
his mistake. The MFR reflected it was placed in “personnel file,” but it does not contain 
Applicant’s signature or any indication that he was shown it or informed about it.8 

 
 
In his background interview, Applicant stated that he counted the pages. At the 
hearing, he testified that every week a  document inventory was conducted and every 
month a more extensive page-by-page document inventory was conducted. He stated 
that he made the mistake of believing this inventory was the weekly document inventory 
instead  of  the  monthly  page-by-page  inventory.  He  claimed  the  team  leader  had 
improperly taken the missing pages and stored them in his room without logging them 
out.  He  believed  the  team  leader  was  setting  a  trap  for  the  guard  conducting  the 
inventory.  This  incident  resulted  in  a  conflict  between  him  and  the  team  leader.  He 
contacted the program manager and reported that the team leader improperly handled 
documents. He also indicated that he wrote a detailed rebuttal to the counseling.9 
 
 
Shortly after the incident on April 17, 2010, Applicant was sent home before the 
completion  of  his  contract.  A  payroll  document  reflected  “[h]e  is  on  probation.  Please 
hold  pay.”  (Allegation  in  SOR  ¶  2.e).  He  stated  that  he  received  all  of  the  written 
warnings/reprimands when he was leaving this overseas location. He further stated that 
he was so upset about being sent home that he did not read the documents that were 
given to him. He did not consider his return to the United States as a termination. His 
program  manager  led  him  believe  that  he  was  sent  back  because  of  the  personality

conflict  with  the  team  leader  and  told  him  that  he  would  get  another  assignment.  He 
resumed working for Company A at another overseas location in October 2010. This is 
also the company that is currently sponsoring Applicant for a security clearance.10 
 
SOR ¶ 2.a – charged with assault on family member in 2009. On January 9, 
 
2009, Applicant was issued a summons to appear in court for the charge of assault on a 
family member, a Class 1 misdemeanor. On April 28, 2009, Applicant pleaded not guilty 
to the charge. The court found there were sufficient facts to establish guilt but deferred 
adjudication  for  one  year.  He  was  required to attend anger-management  classes  and 
avoid committing any offenses. In April 2011, the charge was dismissed.11 
 
 
In  his  e-QIP,  Applicant  disclosed  this  charge.  He  testified  that  his  ex-wife  was 
striking him during an argument. He tried to block her hands but accidently hit her on 
the side of the head with an open hand. He testified that he never hit his ex-wife before 
or after that incident.12 
 

SOR ¶ 2.b – termination from a job during a probationary period in March 
2009.  In  his  e-QIP,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  was  terminated  from  a  security  guard 
position with Company B near the end of a six-month probationary period. Company B 
was  not  required  to  provide  an  explanation  for  the  termination  during  that  period.  He 
noted that he was accused of wearing an earbud linked to an unauthorized MP3 player 
while at work. He stated the earbud was for a cell phone that was permitted. He also 
indicated  that  this  incident  happened  about  a  month  before  his  probationary  period 
ended, and he was never written up for this incident.13  

 
Applicant testified that he believed that he was terminated from the probationary 
position because of the pending domestic-violence charge. If he was convicted of the 
charge, he would have been prohibited from carrying a firearm at work. If he continued 
to  work  for  Company  B  beyond  the  probationary  period,  he  would  have  become  a 
member of the employee’s union and the company would have had to hire an attorney 
to  remove  him  from  the  job  if  he  could  no  longer  carry  a  firearm.    He  indicated  the 
employer was willing to rehire him after the domestic-violence charge was dismissed.14  

 
SOR  ¶  2.c  –  counseled  for  neglect  of  duty  and  falsification  in  September 
2009. Applicant’s background interview reflected that, while employed with Company C 
overseas, he was counseled for neglect of duty and falsification of log book. During the

interview,  he  voluntarily  provided  a  copy  of  the  official  counseling  he  received  on 
September 7, 2009, for this incident.15 

 
Applicant testified that the night shift consisted of two guards who manned two 
posts. Usually the guards would rotate between the posts each night. On the night in 
question, however, the schedule did not rotate the guards between the posts. Applicant 
and  the  other  guard  assumed  their  assignments  were  rotated  and  stood  them  in  that 
manner. In doing so, they signed the logs for the wrong posts. He claimed no dereliction 
of duty occurred because both posts were properly manned. The other guard also was 
written up for this discrepancy.16 

 
SOR ¶ 2.d – illegally gained access to hotel by opening a sliding door in 
2009. While working for Company C overseas from July to December 2009, Applicant 
resided in a hotel. The hotel was connected to a mall. There was a sliding door from the 
mall  to  the  hotel.  After  a  certain  time  each  night,  the  door  was  secured.  On  two 
occasions, Applicant went through the sliding door after it was secured. He claimed that 
he was given permission from the guard in the mall to use the door on both occasions. 
After the second occasion, the hotel management was upset and threatened to kick out 
all of the U.S. contractors from the hotel. Company C agreed to send Applicant back to 
the United States to appease the hotel. He acknowledged that he was given a written 
warning because of this incident. He also stated that he did not consider it a termination 
because he was told it was not his fault and the company would find him another job. 
He met with a company representative for another job opportunity overseas, but soon 
thereafter his father passed away and his mother was in the hospital, which precluded 
him  from  taking  that  job.  In  his  e-QIP,  he  did  not  list  the  reason  for  termination  of 
employment with Company C. Two months later he accepted employment with another 
employer, Company A.17 

 
SOR ¶¶ 2.f and 2.g – falsification allegations. Applicant submitted his e-QIP 
on October 14, 2010. He responded “No” to two similar questions in Paragraphs 2 and 3 
of Section 13C – Your Employment Record. The question in Paragraph 2 asked, “Have 
you received a written warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined 
for  misconduct  in  the  workplace.”  The  question  in  Paragraph  3  asked,  “Have  you 
received  a  written  warning,  been  officially  reprimanded,  suspended,  or  disciplined  for 
violating a security rule or policy.” Of note, Applicant responded “Yes” to the question in 
Paragraph 1 of Section 13C that asked if, for example, he had even been fired, left a job 
under  unfavorable  circumstances  or  been  laid  off,  checked  the  block  “laid  off,”  and 
disclosed  his  termination  of  employment  during  the  six-month  probationary  period 
discussed in SOR ¶ 2.b, above.18

Non-alleged Conduct.21  

in  SOR  ¶  2.f).  He  acknowledged 

 
Applicant stated that he did not disclose the written warnings he received from 
Company A (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c) in his e-QIP because they slipped his mind. (Allegation in 
SOR ¶ 2.g). When he submitted the e-QIP, he was working at an overseas location and 
did not have access to all of his records. He acknowledged that he made a mistake in 
completing the e-QIP, but claimed the errors were accidental. Because of the way the 
written warnings were presented to him and what the program manager had told him, 
he  did  not  believe  the  warnings  were  actually  filed  and  they  were  not  something  that 
stuck in his mind.19  
 
 
Applicant admitted that he also made a mistake in failing to disclose in his e-QIP 
the  written  warning  he  received  for  the  2009  incident  as  set  forth  in  SOR  ¶  2.c. 
(Allegation 
the  written 
warning/reprimand and wrote a lengthy rebuttal to it. He noted that, while completing his 
e-QIP, he was rushed and did not disclose this incident due to an oversight.20 
 
 
 
 
In his background interview, Applicant acknowledged that he received a written 
reprimand in 2006 from a company that he did not list on his e-QIP. The reprimand was 
issued because he reported late to work. In the interview, he claimed he did not list that 
employment and the reprimand on his e-QIP because he forgot about them.22   
 
 
In  his  background  interview,  Applicant  acknowledged  receiving  a  written 
disciplinary action for making an incorrect log entry. While standing a watch at a post, a 
person came to the post and was assisting him. Applicant assumed this person was his 
relief and made an entry in the log to that effect. The person, however, was not his relief 
and the entry did not match who actually relieved him. This incident apparently occurred 
while  he  was  working  for  Company  C  from  July  to  December  2009;  but  is  not  clear 
when this incident happened.23 
 
 
Applicant  testified  that,  since  completing  his  e-QIP,  he  occupied  a  security 
position  in  Afghanistan  for  26  months.  While  there,  he  received  a  written  warning  for 
oversleeping and being late once or twice for his watch. While serving as an armorer, 
he  also  received  a  written  reprimand  for  an  inaccurate  weapons  count.  He  was  also

written up for having cats in his living area.  He received the last written reprimand in 
2014.24 
 
 
Applicant received two non-judicial punishments (Article 15, UCMJ) for military-
related offenses. One offense involved having a cell phone in his locker while he was in 
training from September 2003 to December 2003. He did not disclose either non-judicial 
punishment  on  his  e-QIP.  When  asked  about  the  offense  during  his  background 
interview, he initially stated he received a written warning. Upon being confronted with 
information about the non-judicial punishment, he stated that it was a company-grade 
Article 15, which would have been removed from his service record after a few months. 
From  the  information  in  the  record,  I  am  unable  to  determine  whether  Applicant  was 
required  to  disclose  that  punishment  when  he  responded  “No”  to  the  question  in  his 
October 2010 e-QIP (Section 15d) about being subject to such proceedings in the last 
seven years.25

Policies 

 

The  President  of  the  United  States  has  the  authority  to  control  access  to 
information  bearing  on  national  security  and  to  determine  whether  an  individual  is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  527  (1988).  The  President  has  authorized  the  Secretary  of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified  Information  within  Industry  §  2  (Feb.  20,  1960),  as  amended.  The  U.S. 
Supreme  Court  has  recognized  the  substantial  discretion  of  the  Executive  Branch  in 
regulating  access  to  information  pertaining  to  national  security,  emphasizing  that  “no 
one  has  a  ‘right’  to  a  security  clearance.”  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 

 
Eligibility  for  a  security  clearance  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the 
criteria contained in the AGs. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing  the  complexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in 
conjunction  with  an  evaluation  of  the  whole  person.  An  administrative  judge’s 
adjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  An  administrative 
judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, to reach his decision.

The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard 
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible 
extrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or.  10865  §  7.  See  also  Executive  Order  12968  (Aug.  2,  1995),  Section  3.  Thus,  a 
clearance  decision  is  merely  an  indication  that  the  Applicant  has  or  has  not  met  the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 

 
Initially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in 
the  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 

 
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.”  ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  19,  2002).  The  burden  of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   

 

Analysis 

 

Guideline K, Handling Protected Information 
 
 
information: 
 

AG  ¶  33  sets  forth  the  security  concerns  for  the  handling  of  protected 

Deliberate  or  negligent  failure  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  for 
protecting  classified  or  other  sensitive  information  raises  doubt  about  an 
individual’s  trustworthiness,  judgment,  reliability,  or  unwillingness  and 
ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. 
 
I  have  considered  all  of  the  handling  of  protected  information  disqualifying 

conditions under AG ¶ 34 and the following are potentially applicable: 

 
9 
 
 

(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other 
sensitive information; and  
 
(h)  negligent  or  lax  security  habits  that  persist  despite  counseling  by 
management.  
 
 
In early 2010, Applicant committed a number of security violations that resulted in 
him  being  issued  written  warnings  and  being  returned  early  from  an  overseas 
assignment. AG ¶¶ 34(g) and 34(h) apply. 
 
 
¶ 35: 
 

There are three handling of protected information mitigating conditions under AG 

(a)  so  much  time  has  elapsed  since  the  behavior,  or  it  happened  so 
infrequently  or  under  such  unusual  circumstances,  that  it  is  unlikely  to 
recur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on 
reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security 
training and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of 
security responsibilities; and 
 
(c)  the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. 

individual’s 

the 

 
 
As  the  Appeal  Board  has  stated,  once  it  is  established  that  an  applicant  has 
committed security violations, he or she has a “very heavy burden” of persuasion as to 
mitigation.  Such  violations  “strike  at  the  heart  of  the  industrial  security  program.” 
Accordingly,  a  judge  must  give  any  claims  of  reform  or  rehabilitation  “strict  scrutiny.” 
ISCR Case No. 11-09219 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2014).   
 
 
The conduct in question happened over six years ago. While Applicant has not 
committed any other security violation since then, this conduct should not be considered 
in  isolation,  but  should  be  examined  in  relation  to  his  other  questionable  conduct  as 
alleged under Guideline E. When viewed in  that manner, I am unable to find that his 
conduct  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred  under  unusual 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. In reaching this conclusion, I also considered 
that the security violations happened shortly after he started a new job and he claimed 
he had not received adequate training. Nevertheless, I find that his security violations 
continue  to  cast  doubt  on  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  good  judgment.  None  of 
the mitigating conditions fully apply.  
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 

 

AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  
 

 
10 
 
 

Conduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or 
unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise  questions 
about  an  individual's  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect 
classified information. 
 
AG  ¶  16  describes  conditions  that  could  raise  security  concerns  and  may  be 

disqualifying in this case:  

 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any  personnel  security  questionnaire,  personal  history  statement,  or 
similar  form  used  to  conduct  investigations,  determine  employment 
qualifications,  award  benefits  or  status,  determine  security  eligibility  or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  
 
(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is 
not  sufficient  for  an  adverse  determination  under  any  other  single 
guideline,  but  which,  when  considered  as  a  whole,  supports  a  whole-
person  assessment  of  questionable 
judgment,  untrustworthiness, 
unreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and 
regulations,  or  other  characteristics  indicating  that  the  person  may  not 
properly safeguard protected information; and 
 
(d)  credible  adverse  information  that  is  not  explicitly  covered  under  any 
other  guideline  and  may  not  be  sufficient  by  itself  for  an  adverse 
determination,  but  which,  when  combined  with  all  available  evidence 
information  supports  a  whole-person  assessment  of  questionable 
judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that 
the  person  may  not  properly  safeguard  protected  information.  This 
includes  but  is  not  limited  to  consideration  of:  (1)  untrustworthy  or 
unreliable behavior. . . ; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; (4) 
evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer’s time or 
resources. 
 
I  did  not  find  Applicant’s  testimony  convincing  that  he  forgot  about  the  written 
warnings he received for the security violations in 2010 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c), or the written 
counseling he received for dereliction of duty and falsification of a document in 2009. 
The security violations happened about six month before he submitted his e-QIP. Due 
to  those  security  violations,  he  was  sent  home  from  an  overseas  location,  placed  on 
probation, and was not employed for the intervening six months. It is not believable that 
he would have forgotten about those recent events when he submitted his e-QIP at the 
start of his next job. His claim that he did not have the records or written warnings with 
him  when  he  submitted  the  e-QIP  is  likewise  not  persuasive.  I  find  that  Applicant 
deliberately falsified his 2010 e-QIP when he failed to disclose those written warnings 
and counseling. AG ¶ 16(a) applies.  

 
11 
 
 

Applicant  was  charged  with  a  domestic  assault  in  2009,  terminated  from  a 
probationary  job  in  2009,  counseled  for  misconduct  at  the  work  place  in  2009, 
terminated  from  employment  due  to  misconduct  in  2009,  and  committed  multiple 
security  violations  that  resulted  in  his  early  return  from  an  overseas  assignment  and 
employment probation in 2010. Viewed in its entirety, his conduct reflects a pattern of 
unreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor judgment. AG ¶¶16(c) and 16(d) apply.  

 
Five  personal  conduct  mitigation  conditions  under  AG  ¶  17  are  potentially 

applicable: 

 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b)  the  refusal  or  failure  to  cooperate,  omission,  or  concealment  was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware  of  the  requirement  to  cooperate  or  provide  the  information,  the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on  the  individual's  reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to  change  the  behavior  or  taken  other  positive  steps  to  alleviate  the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;  
 
(e)  the  individual  has  taken  positive  steps  to  reduce  or  eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and 
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability. 
 
Applicant’s alleged conduct, including his e-QIP falsifications, occurred over five 
years  ago.  He  denied  the  falsifications  in  his  Answer  to  the  SOR  and  at  the  hearing, 
which shows that he has not reformed and rehabilitated himself.  All of his misconduct 
must be viewed in its entirety. From the evidence presented, I am unable to find that his 
questionable  conduct  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred  under 
unique  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur.  None  of  the  Guideline  E  mitigating 
conditions fully apply.

Whole-Person Concept 

 Under  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  

the  conduct, 

the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of 
to 

the 
the  conduct;  (2) 
(1) 
circumstances  surrounding 
include  knowledgeable 
participation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which  participation 
the  presence  or  absence  of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  

is  voluntary;  (6) 

The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful  consideration  of  the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. After considering the whole-person evidence 
in the record, I continue to have questions and doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and 
suitability for a security clearance. From the foregoing, I conclude that Applicant failed to 
mitigate the handling protected information and personal conduct security concerns.  

Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are:          
 

Paragraph 1, Guideline K:

In  light  of  all  the  circumstances  presented  by  the  record,  it  is  not  clearly

security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.

GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 

 
Applicant  mitigated  the  security  concerns  regarding  personal  conduct,  use  of 
information technology systems, and foreign influence. Eligibility for a security clearance 
and access to classified information is granted. 

 

Statement of the Case 

 
On  April  28,  2010,  Applicant  applied  for  a  security  clearance  and  submitted  an 
Electronic  Questionnaire  for  Investigations  Processing  (e-QIP)  version  of  a  Security 
Clearance  Application.1  On  an  unspecified  date,  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD) 
Consolidated  Adjudications  Facility  (CAF)  issued  him  a  set  of  interrogatories.  He 
responded  to  the  interrogatories  on  January  2, 2013.2  On  January  12, 2015,  the  DOD 
CAF  issued  a  Statement  of  Reasons  (SOR)  to  him,  under  Executive  Order  10865, 
Safeguarding  Classified  Information  within  Industry  (February  20,  1960),  as  amended 
and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6,  Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  and  modified  (Directive);    and  the

Adjudicative  Guidelines  for  Determining  Eligibility  For  Access  to  Classified  Information 
(December  29,  2005)  (AG)  applicable  to  all  adjudications  and  other  determinations 
made  under  the  Directive,  effective  September  1,  2006.  The  SOR  alleged  security 
concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct), B (Foreign Influence), and M (Use of 
Information  Technology  Systems),  and  detailed  reasons  why  the  DOD  adjudicators 
were  unable  to  find  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  or 
continue  a  security  clearance  for  Applicant.  The  SOR  recommended  referral  to  an 
administrative  judge  to  determine  whether  a  clearance  should  be  granted,  continued, 
denied, or revoked.  

 
 
Applicant  received  the  SOR  on  January  28,  2015.  In  an  unsworn  declaration, 
dated February 17, 2015,3 Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government 
was prepared to proceed on August 3, 2015. The case was assigned to me on October 
5, 2015. A Notice of Hearing was issued on October 28, 2015. I convened the hearing 
as scheduled on November 17, 2015. 
 
 
During the hearing, three Government exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, and eight of the 
nine Applicant exhibits (AE) A, B, and D through I, were admitted into evidence without 
objection.  AE  C  was  admitted  over  the  objection,  based  on  hearsay,  of  Department 
Counsel.  Applicant  and  one  witness  testified.  The  transcript  (TR.)  was  received  on 
November  25,  2015.  I  kept  the  record  open  to  enable  Applicant  to  supplement  it. 
Applicant  took  advantage  of  that  opportunity.  He  timely  submitted  a  number  of 
documents  which  were  marked  as  AE  J  and  K,  and  admitted  into  evidence  without 
objection. The record closed on December 1, 2015. 
 

Findings of Fact 

 

In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied, with explanations, all of the factual 
 
treated  as  admissions,  are 
allegations  of 
incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the 
evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due  consideration  of  same,  I  make  the  following 
additional findings of fact: 

the  SOR.  Applicant’s  explanations, 

Applicant  is  a  56-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  who,  since  August 
2014, has been serving as a systems administrator. He had previously been a systems 
administrator,  systems  analyst,  field  engineer,  or  programmer  with  other  employers 
since  August  1981.4  He  has  never  served  in  the  U.S.  military.5  He  was  apparently 
granted a secret security clearance in 2001, with a renewal granted in 2013,  and what 
he referred to as an EBI clearance from 1982 until 1986.6 A 1977 high school graduate,

Applicant  received  a  bachelor  of  arts  degree  in  Computer  Science  in  May  1981.7 
Applicant  was  married  in  August  1984,  separated  in  December  2009,  and  divorced  in 
July  2010.  He  married  his  current  wife  in  October  2014.8  He  adopted  his  first  wife’s 
daughter (born in 1976) in the mid-1980’s.9 

Applicant and his first wife started drifting apart and went through several years 
filled with marital issues leading up to their separation and actual divorce. She refused 
to  attend  Applicant’s  father’s  funeral  in  1995,  his  mother’s  funeral  in  1999,  his  college 
reunion, or his niece’s wedding in 2008. He claimed  it got to the point where he asked 
her  to  help  him  with  something  and  she  refused.  He  experienced  a  difficult  residence 
reconstruction  project.  There  was  a  lack  of  communication  between  Applicant  and  his 
wife.  After  the  separation,  attempted  reconciliations  failed.  During  the  period  of  his 
separation,  an  employer’s  contract  ended  and  his  position  was  vacated.  He  searched 
for  a  new  position,  and  actually  obtained  several  short-term  ones.  During  the  period 
2004 until 2013, 18 friends or relatives passed away. Applicant incurred several injuries, 
illnesses,  and  conditions,  and  he  went  through  several  surgeries.  At  least  one  very 
close friend noticed the emotional stress that the various issues were causing Applicant. 
To  minimize  the  stress  which  really  started  to  affect  him  in  about  2006,  and  to  relax, 
Applicant 
turned  to  playing  Internet  games  and  chatting  during  online  dating 
relationships.10 

 

Use of Information Technology Systems & Personal Conduct 
  

(SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  and  3.a.):  Applicant  was  employed  by  a  particular  government 
contractor  from  May  2010  until  July  2010.  On  or  about  July  24,  2010,  Applicant  was 
looking through his personal e-mails on his government furnished equipment (GFE), a 
computer,  and  accessed  some  online  dating  sites,  sports  sites,  and  book  sites. When 
he  opened  some  unsolicited  e-mails,  he  found  that  they  contained  photos  of  nude 
women.  One  e-mail  contained  one  photo  of  five  nude  women  and  another  e-mail  had 
one  photo  which  he  considered  offensive,  but  did  not  describe.  He  claimed  that  if  he 
had  known  the  e-mails  contained  photos  of  nude  women,  he  would  not  have  opened 
them  on  his  office  GFE.  He  immediately  deleted  the  e-mails  after  conferring  with  a 
colleague.  Applicant  denied  that  he  ever  intentionally  used  his  GFE  to  look  at 
pornographic photos. This was the only time any of the e-mails he opened on his GFE 
contained photos of nude women. In addition, Applicant’s GFE computer screen saver 
and  wall  paper  contained  approximately  eight  photos  of  his  scantly  clothed  girlfriend 
which were not pornographic.11

On  or  about  July  27,  2010,  one  of  Applicant’s  supervisors  approached  him  and 
asked  to  see  the  photos  of  his  residence  reconstruction  project.  Applicant’s  GFE 
computer wallpaper included photographs of his then-girlfriend in a bikini. After viewing 
her photos and photos of the residence, the supervisor departed. What occurred next is 
unclear.  Applicant  was  initially  of  the  belief  that  she  went  directly  to  the  information 
technology  (IT)  department  and  asked  that  Applicant’s  GFE  computer  be  scanned. 
There is also some evidence that Applicant’s  GFE was merely randomly scanned. The 
actual fact in this regard in unimportant. According to an incident report filed on July 30, 
2010, the scan of Applicant’s GFE found that he had been accessing websites for online 
dating which were characterized as “inappropriate,” as well as 15 photos that were also 
characterized as “inappropriate.” Two of the photos were deemed “sexually explicit” and 
“pornographic” in nature.12  

 
On  July  28,  2010,  Applicant  was  terminated  from  his  employment  without 
warning due to “violation of company policy” and “unauthorized use of GFE for sexually 
explicit  or  sexually  oriented materials.”13  Although  the  SOR  alleged  that Applicant  was 
terminated  from  employment  for  “viewing  pornographic  websites,”  the  evidence  upon 
which  the  allegations  are  based,  the  Incident  History,  simply  refers  to  them  as 
“inappropriate websites.”14 The two terms are not synonymous. 

 
There  is  no  IT  report  of  specific  findings,  a  report  of  investigation  by  the 
employer, a copy of the company policy supposedly violated by Applicant, copies of the 
troublesome  photographs,  or  explicit  descriptions  of  what  were  construed  as  sexually 
explicit  of  pornographic,  in  evidence.  There  is  no  evidence  of  any  subsequent  alleged 
misuse of GFE or violations of company policies.15 

 

Foreign Influence 
 
 
Over  a  period  estimated  by  Applicant  to  be  15  months,  Applicant  chatted  with 
various  foreign  individuals  while  playing  online  games  and  involved  in  online  dating.  He 
explained  that  to  be  successful  in  these  games,  it  was  necessary  to  “ally”  with  as  many 
individuals  as  possible  to  assist  him  in  winning.  The  games  required  communication  and 
occasional  chats.  Applicant’s  online  dating  resulted  in  “relationships”  with  several  foreign 
women, but none of those “relationships” involved physically seeing or meeting the women 
except by telephone, or photographs and videos.  
 

One such “relationship” with a woman in the Philippines in November 2009 involved 
his sending various sums of money to her via Western Union. Applicant’s two explanations 
regarding  the  amounts  sent  her  are  inconsistent.  He  told  an  investigator  from  the  U.S. 
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  in  October  2010  that  he  had  sent  her  $6,000  for 
plane reservations, $7,000 for her father’s medical care, and $25 for support.  He changed

reservations,  and  $25  on  two  occasions.  When  she  asked  for  more,  he  said  no,  and  the 
“relationship”  ended.16  Because  Applicant’s  initial  explanation  was  only  months  after  the 
fact, and the most recent one was five years later, I have given the initial explanation more 
weight as being more reliable. 
 
 
In  February  2010,  Applicant  established  a  “relationship”  with  a  woman  from 
Malaysia.  He  also  sent  her  various  sums  of  money  via  Western  Union.  Once  again, 
Applicant’s  two  explanations  regarding  the  amounts  sent  her  are  inconsistent.  He  told  the 
OPM investigator that he had sent her $20,000 for plane reservations, $3,000 to have her 
released from Thai customs because she supposedly possessed gold bars, and $37,000 for 
plane  reservations  to  return  home.  He  changed  the  amounts  during  the  hearing,  and  said 
he sent her $2,000 for plane reservations. He added that he also sent her unspecified sums 
on  over  ten  occasions.  Western  Union  eventually  stopped  Applicant  from  sending  funds 
overseas.  When  she  asked  for  more,  he  said  no,  and  the  “relationship”  ended.17  Once 
again, because Applicant’s initial explanation was only months after the fact, and the most 
recent  one  was  five  years  later,  I  have  given  the  initial  explanation  more  weight  as  being 
more reliable. 
 
On  an  unspecified  date,  Applicant  established  another  “relationship”  with  a  woman 
 
from the Philippines. He sent her various sums of money via Money Gram. Applicant’s two 
explanations regarding the amounts sent her are inconsistent. He told the OPM investigator 
that he had sent her $200 to pay her way out of her contract with her handler, and $50 for 
living expenses. He changed the amounts during the hearing, and said he sent her $370 to 
buy  out  her  contract.  The  “relationship”  ended.18  Once  again,  because  Applicant’s  initial 
explanation was only months after the fact, and the most recent one was five years later, I 
have given the initial explanation more weight as being more reliable. 
 

In November 2009, Applicant established another “relationship” with a woman from 
the Philippines. He sent her an unspecified sum of money to travel to the United States, but 
she used it for other purposes. When she requested additional money, he refused to send it 
and the “relationship” ended.19 

 
Applicant  met  other  foreign  women  over  the  Internet,  but  none  of  those  involved 
sending  money  to  them,  even  though  some  of  the  women  requested  money.  He 
acknowledged that some of the women were taking advantage of him in scams, but he was 
not aware of the truth until later. He denied having a bond of affection, loyalty, or friendship 
obligation  for  any  of  the  foreign  nationals  with  whom  he  had  the  aforementioned 
“relationships.” Applicant entered into an exclusive relationship with the woman who is now 
his  wife  in  May  2011.  He  no  longer  plays  any  of  the  Internet  games  and  has  ceased  all

$197,000 in 2009, before his income dropped substantially in 2010. 21 

On  February  9,  2015,  Applicant  underwent  a  self-referred  psychological 
evaluation conducted by a licensed psychologist.22 He was interviewed face-to-face for 
nearly  four  hours  and  administered  several  tests.  The  psychologist  determined  that 
Applicant  was  “characteristically  other-oriented,  i.e.,  his  concerns  and  focus  are 
compassionately  for  the  safety  and  well-being  of  others.”23  The  psychologist  opined 
that24  

prominent in [Applicant’s] character are the traits of a positive work ethic; a 
respect for authority and boundaries; being reliable and dependable; being 
determined and committed to success and the organizations he works for, 
being  very  moral  and  having  a  well-developed  conscience  to  guide  him 
interpersonally; and having a superior intellect.  

The psychologist concluded that the incidents reported are25  

an anomaly, incongruent with [Applicant’s] character, and do not represent 
an  ongoing  pattern  of  behavior  or  in  his  interpersonal  proclivities.  He

Character References and Work Performance 

Former colleagues from his time with various employers, including one who has 
known him since 1988, as well as current managers, supervisors, and colleagues, have 
all  commented  favorably  about  Applicant.  One,  who  has  known  Applicant  since  1993, 
characterized  him  as  working  relentlessly,  learning  continuously,  retaining  knowledge 
indefinitely, and applying knowledge steadily. He added that Applicant is on the short list 
of people he would trust with his life, and on an even shorter list of those he would trust 
with  his  money  and  his  family.26  Others  have  referred  to  Applicant’s  reliability, 
trustworthiness,  good  moral  character,  integrity,  discretion,  loyalty,  honesty,  efficiency,

professionalism,  problem-solving  skills,  and  strong  work  ethic.27  Applicant’s  very  close 
friend,  a  person  who  has  known  him  since  1988,  described  the  emotional  stress  with 
which  Applicant  was  previously  dealing.  After  Applicant  went  through  what  he  called 
“that patch of time,” Applicant started returning to his old self.28 He served as a middle 
school basketball coach, and he became a basketball referee and baseball umpire for 
12  years.  He  was  also  active  in  the  community  chapters  of  several  national  service 
organizations.29  Over  the  years,  Applicant  completed  many  professional  improvement 
courses,30  and  he  was  awarded  a  number  of  different  certificates  of  appreciation  or 
monetary  awards.31  Applicant’s  2014  performance  review  reflects  a  person  who 
achieves expectations.32

The  U.S.  Supreme  Court  has  recognized  the  substantial  discretion  of  the 
Executive  Branch  in  regulating  access  to  information  pertaining  to  national  security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”33 As Commander in Chief, 
the  President  has  the  authority  to  control  access  to  information  bearing  on  national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to  such  information.  The  President  has  authorized  the  Secretary  of  Defense  or  his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”34   
 

When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability 

the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for  each  guideline,  the  AG  list  potentially  disqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information.

all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and  present,  favorable  and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 

In  the  decision-making  process,  facts  must  be  established  by  “substantial 
evidence.”35 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a  potentially  disqualifying  condition  under  the  Directive,  and  has  the  burden  of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial  evidence  of  a  disqualifying  condition,  under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the 
applicant  has  the  burden  of  persuasion  to  present  evidence  in  refutation,  explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.36  

the  Government  predicated  upon 

 
A  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary 
trust  and  confidence.  This 
relationship  with 
relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and  endures  throughout  off-duty  hours  as 
well.  It  is  because  of  this  special  relationship  that  the  Government  must  be  able  to 
repose  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  those  individuals  to  whom  it  grants 
access  to  classified  information.  Decisions  include,  by  necessity,  consideration  of  the 
possible  risk  the applicant may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to safeguard  classified 
information. Such decisions  entail  a  certain degree  of  legally  permissible  extrapolation 
as  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified  information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”37 

 
Clearance  decisions  must  be  “in  terms  of  the  national  interest  and  shall  in  no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”38 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or  patriotism.  It  is  merely  an  indication  the  Applicant  has  or  has  not  met  the  strict 
guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have  established  for  issuing  a 
clearance.    In  reaching  this  decision,  I  have  drawn  only  those  conclusions  that  are 
reasonable,  logical,  and  based  on  the  evidence  contained  in  the  record.  Likewise,  I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

Guideline M, Information Technology Systems 
 

Analysis 

 

The  security  concern  under  the  guideline  for  Use  of  Information  Technology 

Systems is set out in AG ¶ 39:   

rules,  procedures,  guidelines  or 

 
regulations 
Noncompliance  with 
pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns 
about  an  individual's  reliability  and  trustworthiness,  calling  into  question 
the  willingness  or  ability  to  properly  protect  sensitive  systems,  networks, 
and  information.  Information  Technology  Systems  include  all  related 
computer  hardware,  software, 
the 
communication, 
transmission,  processing,  manipulation,  storage,  or 
protection of information. 

firmware,  and  data  used 

for 

The  guideline notes  a  condition  that  could  raise  security  concerns.  Under  AG ¶ 
40(e),  security  concerns  may  be  raised  by  the  “unauthorized  use  of  a  government  or 
other  information  technology  system.”  This  guideline  generally  refers  to  sending  or 
soliciting sexually-oriented messages or images, or the downloading, creating, storing, 
or  displaying  computer  files  of  a  sexual  nature.  In  mid-2010,  Applicant  opened  an 
Internet  site  on  his  GFE  that  his  employer  considered  an  “inappropriate”  website.  The 
sole  evidence  pertaining  to  it  was  the  name,  and  that  name,  without  more,  seems  to 
indicate  it  was  an  online  dating  website.  There  is  zero  evidence  that  it  was  a 
“pornographic”  website.  In  July  2010,  while  he  was  again  on  the  GFE,  he opened  two 
unsolicited  e-mails  addressed  to  him.  One  of  the  e-mails  contained  photos  of  nude 
women  and  the  other  contained  a  photo  of  what  he  considered  offensive.  Applicant 
promptly  deleted  the  e-mails.  He  also  had  photos  of  his  scantily  clad  girlfriend  on  his 
screen saver and wall paper. A subsequent computer scan of his GFE conducted by the 
IT department revealed the access to the “inappropriate” website as well as the photos 
that  were  characterized  as  “inappropriate.”  Two  of  the  photos  were  deemed  “explicit” 
and  “pornographic”  in  nature.  As  a  result,  the  following  day,  Applicant  was  terminated 
from his employment due to “violation of company policy” and “unauthorized use of GFE 
for sexually explicit or sexually oriented materials.” AG ¶ 40(e) has been established. 
 
 
The  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  such 
security  concerns.  Under  AG  ¶  41(a),  the  disqualifying  condition  may  be  mitigated 
where  “so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under 
such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Similarly, AG ¶ 41(c) applies 
where  “the  conduct  was  unintentional  or  inadvertent  and  was  followed  by  a  prompt, 
good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of supervisor.”  
 
 
While  Applicant  did  not  promptly  notify  his  supervisor,  he  did  confer  with  a 
colleague to determine what to do, and he immediately deleted the e-mails in an effort 
to correct the situation. According to the apparent prevailing community standards, the 
employer  considered  two  of  the  photos  to  be  “sexually  explicit”  and  “pornographic”  in

nature.  Department  Counsel  argued  that  this  was  not  the  only  such  incident  and  that 
Applicant  “had  a  history  of  viewing  this  material.”39  His  argument  is  based  purely  on 
speculation,  for  there  is  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  it  happened  more  than  once. 
Nevertheless,  even  assuming  the  accuracy  of  the  allegation,  the  passing  of  over  four 
and  one-half  years  from  the  incident  to  the  date  the  SOR  was  issued,  without 
recurrence,  is  sufficient  to  conclude  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur,  and  it  no  longer  casts 
doubt  on  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  good  judgment.    AG  ¶  41(a) 
applies, and AG ¶ 41(c) partially applies. 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 

The security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG & 15:       

 

Conduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or 
unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise  questions 
about  an  individual's  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect 
classified  information.  Of  special  interest  is  any  failure  to  provide  truthful 
and  candid  answers  during  the  security  clearance  process  or  any  other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
The  guideline  notes  conditions  that  could  raise  security  concerns.  Under  AG  ¶ 

16(c), security concerns may be raised by:  

credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not 
sufficient  for  an  adverse  determination  under  any  other  single  guideline, 
but  which,  when  considered  as  a  whole,  supports  a  whole-person 
assessment  of  questionable  judgment,  untrustworthiness,  unreliability, 
lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other 
characteristics  indicating  that  the  person  may  not  properly  safeguard 
protected information. 

Also, it is potentially disqualifying under AG ¶ 16(e) when there is: 

personal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, that 
creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) 
engaging  in  activities  which,  if  known,  may  affect  the  person’s  personal, 
professional, or community standing. . . .  

The  alleged  behavior  consisted  of  being  involuntarily  terminated  from  his 
employment  in  July  2010  for  “viewing  pornographic  websites.”  Applicant  has  been 
consistent  in  his  rendition  of  the  facts.  The  evidence  is  not  in  dispute.  Applicant  was 
involuntarily  terminated  from  his  employment  due  to  “violation  of  company  policy”  and 
“unauthorized  use  of  GFE  for  sexually  explicit  or  sexually  oriented  materials.”  The  IT 
scan  of  Applicant’s  GFE  revealed  that  he  viewed  an  “inappropriate”  online  dating 
website, but there is zero evidence that the website was “pornographic” in nature.  The

allegation  failed  to  address  the  issues  related  to  the  e-mails.  Nevertheless,  there  is 
reason for further discussion. AG ¶¶ 16(c) and 16(e) have been partially established.  

 
The  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security 
concerns  arising  from  personal  conduct.  AG  ¶  17(c)  may  apply  if  “the  offense  is  so 
minor,  or  so  much  time  has  passed,  or  the  behavior  is  so  infrequent,  or  it  happened 
under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on 
the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.”  

 
Similarly, AG ¶ 17(d) may apply if “the individual has acknowledged the behavior 
and  obtained  counseling  to  change  the  behavior  or  taken  other  positive  steps  to 
alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or  other  inappropriate  behavior,  and  such  behavior  is  unlikely  to  recur.”  Also,  if  “the 
individual  has  taken  positive  steps  to  reduce  or  eliminate  vulnerability  to  exploitation, 
manipulation, or duress,” AG ¶ 17(e) may apply. 

  
In  July  2010,  during  a  period  when  Applicant  was  under  substantial  emotional 
stress,  he  was  involuntarily  terminated  from  his  employment  due  to  “violation  of 
company policy” and “unauthorized use of GFE for sexually explicit or sexually oriented 
materials.” The alleged behavior, both the viewing of an “inappropriate website as well 
as  the  opening  of  unsolicited  e-mails  each  occurred  on  one  occasion,  over  four  and 
one-half years before the SOR was issued. Applicant took positive efforts to reduce or 
eliminate  the  behavior  of  online  dating  and  game-playing.  He  remarried.  He  was 
subsequently  evaluated  by  a  licensed  psychologist  and  found  to  be  free  of  any 
psychological  disorders.  He  acknowledged  his  behavior.  There  is  no  evidence  of  any 
subsequent  alleged  personal  conduct.  Considering  the  fact  that  the  “inappropriate” 
website dealt with online dating, and not pornography, the significance of the personal 
conduct  is  minimized.  Applicant  has  reduced  or  eliminated  his  vulnerability  to 
exploitation, and through his rehabilitative efforts, the  alleged untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, is unlikely to recur. AG ¶¶ 17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) apply. 
 
Guideline B, Foreign Influence 
 

The security concern under the Foreign Influence guideline is set out in AG ¶ 6:       

Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual 
has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or 
induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a 
way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by 
any  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should 
consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or 
financial 
to,  such 
considerations  as  whether  the  foreign  country  is  known  to  target  United 
States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a 
risk of terrorism.

11 

                                      
 

The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG  ¶  7(a),  it  is  potentially  disqualifying  where  there  is  “contact  with  a  foreign  family 
member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of 
or  resident  in  a  foreign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign 
exploitation,  inducement,  manipulation,  pressure,  or  coercion.”  Similarly,  under  AG  ¶ 
7(e), security concerns may be raised when there is  “a substantial business, financial, 
or  property  interest  in  a  foreign  country,  or  in  any  foreign-owned  or  foreign-operated 
business,  which  could  subject  the  individual  to  heightened  risk  of  foreign  influence  or 
exploitation.  

Applicant  is  not  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen.  He  was  born  in  the  United  States  of 
parents  who  were  also  born  in  the  United  States.  His  entire  immediate  and  extended 
family members are also U.S. citizens. There is no evidence (or allegations) that he has 
any  family  members  or  business  or  professional  associates  who  are  citizens  or 
residents of a foreign  country. In 2009 and 2010, he did, however, have long-distance 
online and telephone relationships with several women who were foreign-born residents 
of  various  countries.  Although  he  never  physically  saw  or  met  the  women,  except  by 
telephone, photographs, or videos, he did send them various sums of money, estimated 
to  be  a  total  in  excess  of  $60,000,  allegedly  earmarked  by  the  recipients  for 
transportation,  medical  care,  support,  and  release 
from  a  customs.  Applicant 
acknowledged that some of the women were taking advantage of him in scams, but he 
was not aware of the truth until later. He denied having a bond of affection, loyalty, or 
friendship  obligation  for  any  of  the  foreign  nationals  with  whom  he  had  the 
aforementioned “relationships.”   

Applicant’s online dating and gaming forays with foreign women ceased in 2011 
when  he  met  the  woman  who  eventually  became  his  second  wife.  The  security 
significance  of  these  identified  conditions  requires  further  examination  of  Applicant’s 
former  foreign  “relationships”  to  determine  the  degree  of  “heightened  risk”  or  potential 
conflict  of  interest.  Furthermore,  Department  Counsel  argued  that  Applicant’s  actions 
revealed  cloudy  judgment,  a  lack  of  self-discipline,  and  a  vulnerability    to  possible 
manipulation and exploitation.  The SOR alleged that Applicant wired money to various 
oversea  locations  “in  an  attempt  to  incite  the  relationships.”  (Emphasis  added).40  The 
evidence  is  persuasive  that,  after  nearly  three  decades  of  marriage  and  a  separation 
and pending divorce, Applicant was active in online dating and simply wished to make 
the right social connection with a female. Nevertheless, AG ¶¶ 7(a) and 7(e) are partially 
established. 

The  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security 
concerns  arising  from  foreign  influence.  Under  AG  ¶  8(a),  the  disqualifying  condition 
may be mitigated where: 

                                                           

40  It  is  unclear  why  the  word  “incite”  was  used  in  the  SOR  for  that  word  generally  conveys  a  negative 
implication, such as to stir up, fan the flames of, provoke, inflame, egg on, whip up, or foment. The evidence seems to 
infer another meaning such as encourage, kindle, arouse, or stimulate.

the  nature  of  the  relationships  with  foreign  persons,  the  country  in  which 
these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in 
that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be  placed  in  a 
position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, 
group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.  

Similarly, AG ¶ 8(b) may apply where the evidence shows:  

there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual's  sense  of 
loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is 
so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships 
and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any 
conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. 

In  addition,  AG  ¶  8(c)  may  apply  where  “contact  or  communication  with  foreign 
citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk 
for foreign influence or exploitation.”  

In  assessing  whether  there  is  a  heightened  risk  because  of  an  applicant’s 
“relationships”  in  foreign  countries,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  all  relevant  factors, 
including the totality of an applicant’s conduct and circumstances in light of any realistic 
potential  for  exploitation.  One  such  factor  is  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion, 
exploitation,  or  duress.  In  that  regard,  it  is  important  to  realize  that  Applicant  never 
intended to, and did not, leave the U.S. to enter any of the foreign countries, and that 
his  sole  intent  was  to  have  individuals  travel  to  the  U.S.  for  brief  visits  to  explore 
possible continuing relationships. In fact, none of those foreign women ever entered the 
U.S., and their sole purpose was seemingly to scam money from Applicant. Yes, he did 
send the women substantial sums of money, but any “relationships” that he might have 
developed with them ceased in 2010 or 2011, at least four years before the SOR was 
issued.  In  those  circumstances,  there  is  very  little  potential  for  pressure,  coercion, 
exploitation, or duress.  

 
Applicant’s  immediate  family  and  extended  family  still  reside  in  the  U.S.,  and 
those  foreign  women  still  remain  overseas  without  any  continuing  contact  with 
Applicant.  There  is  no  risk,  much  less  a  “heightened  risk,”  of  foreign  exploitation, 
inducement,  manipulation,  pressure,  or  coercion  to  disqualify  Applicant  from  holding  a 
security  clearance  because  of  any  close  or  continuing  relationship  with  those  foreign 
women.  While  Applicant  may  have  been  somewhat  naive,  and  displayed  a  lack  of 
judgment, in falling for scams and sending such large sums of money to strangers, I am 
persuaded that Applicant’s loyalty to the United States is steadfast and undivided, and 
that he has “such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that [he] 
can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.” AG ¶¶ 
8(a), 8(b), and 8(f) apply.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 
Under  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct  and  all  the  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the  nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 

the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of 
to 

the 
the  conduct;  (2) 
(1) 
circumstances  surrounding 
include  knowledgeable 
participation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the 
individual’s  age  and maturity  at  the  time  of the  conduct;  (5)  the  extent to 
which  participation 
the  presence  or  absence  of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 

the  conduct, 

is  voluntary;  (6) 

 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects  of this  case  in  light  of the  totality  of  the  record evidence and have  not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.41       

There  is  some  evidence  against  mitigating  Applicant’s  use  of  information 
technology  systems,  personal  conduct,  and  foreign  influence  concerns.  Applicant  was 
involuntarily  terminated  from  his  employment  due  to  “violation  of  company  policy”  and 
“unauthorized  use  of  GFE  for  sexually  explicit  or  sexually  oriented  materials.”  The  IT 
scan  of  Applicant’s  GFE  revealed  that  he  viewed  an  “inappropriate”  online  dating 
website,  and on one occasion  in  July  2010, he  opened  two  unsolicited  e-mails,  one of 
which  happened  to  contain  photos  of  nude  women,  and  the  other  of  which  contained 
something  that  he  considered  “offensive.”  In  2009  and  2010,  he  engaged  in  long-
distance online and telephone relationships with several women who were foreign-born 
residents of various countries. He sent them various sums of money, estimated to be a 
total  in  excess  of  $60,000,  allegedly  earmarked  by  the  recipients  for  transportation, 
medical care, support, and release from a customs.  

The  mitigating  evidence  under  the  whole-person  concept  is  more  substantial. 
Applicant’s alleged behavior occurred over four and one-half years before the SOR was 
issued, and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature. There is no 
evidence  of  a  personality  disorder.  Applicant  has  a  good  reputation  for  reliability, 
trustworthiness,  good  moral  character,  integrity,  discretion,  loyalty,  honesty,  efficiency, 
professionalism,  problem-solving  skills,  and  a  strong  work  ethic.  He  was  active  in  his 
community,  and  served  as  a  middle  school  basketball  coach,  as  well  as  a  basketball

GOLDSTEIN, Jennifer I., Administrative Judge: 

 
Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has a history of 
financial  delinquencies,  including  delinquent  debts  owed  to  eight  creditors  in  the 
approximate  amount  of  $37,847.  While  Applicant  has  either  resolved  or  is  making 
payments  on  five  of  his  debts,  he  failed  to  establish  that  three  others  are  being 
addressed. Applicant has  not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns 
because he has failed to show he  acted responsibly with respect to  these outstanding 
debts. He mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns created by his mother, two 
sisters, and three brothers, who are all citizens and residents of Vietnam. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is denied.  
 

Statement of the Case 

 

On  December  5,  2014,  the  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA) 
issued  a  Statement  of  Reasons  (SOR)  to  Applicant  detailing  security  concerns  under 
Guideline  F,  Financial  Considerations  and  Guideline  B,  Foreign  Influence.  The  action 
was  taken  under  Executive  Order  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified  Information 
within  Industry  (February  20,  1960),  as  amended;  Department  of  Defense  Directive 

 

 
1 

5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review Program  (January  2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases 
after September 1, 2006. (Item 1.) 

 
Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on January 11, 2015 and February 2, 
 
2015. (Item 1.) He requested that his case be decided by an administrative judge on the 
written  record.  Department  Counsel  submitted  the  Government’s  written  case  on  April 
21,  2016.  A  complete  copy  of  the  File  of  Relevant  Material  (FORM),  containing  five 
Items, was received by Applicant on April 27, 2016. He was afforded an opportunity to 
file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days 
of  his  receipt of  the  FORM.  Applicant  submitted documents  marked  Applicant  Exhibits 
(AE) A through K in response to the FORM within the 30-day period that ended May 27, 
2016.  Department  Counsel  had  no  objection  to  AE  A  through  AE  K,  and  they  are 
admitted into the record. DOHA assigned the case to me on December 13, 2016.  
 

Procedural Rulings 

 

 
In  the  FORM,  the  Government  requested  I  take  administrative  notice  of  certain 
facts  relating  to  Vietnam.  Department  Counsel  provided  a  five-page  summary  of  the 
facts,  supported  by  five  Government  documents  pertaining  to  Vietnam,  identified  as 
Item  6.  The  documents  provide  elaboration  and  context  for  the  summary.  I  take 
administrative  notice  of  the  facts  included  in  the  U.S.  Government  reports.  They  are 
limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set 
out in the Findings of Fact. 

 

Findings of Fact 

 
 
Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b. He failed 
to explicitly admit or deny SOR subparagraph 1.a through 1.h, and as a result, they will 
be treated as denials. (Item 1.) After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, and 
exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. 
 
 
Applicant is 51 years old. He was born in Vietnam and immigrated to the United 
States. He attended a U.S. high school. He became a U.S. citizen in 1981.  He earned 
an  associate’s  degree  in  1984  from  a  U.S.  college.  He  was  employed  by  a  federal 
contractor from February 2011 until he was laid off in February 2013. He is married to a 
U.S. citizen, and has two children who are U. S. citizens. (Item 2.) 
 
 
approximate amount of $37,847. His debts are as follows. 
 
 
Applicant  is  delinquent  on  his  $257,199  primary  mortgage  in  the  amount  of 
$10,420,  as  alleged  in  SOR  subparagraph  1.a.  He  presented  documentation  showing 
he made payments of $2,085 to this creditor on December 26, 2014, January 20, 2015, 
and  May  14,  2016.  He  indicated  in  a  letter  that  he  was  trying  to  bring  this  account 
current. However, he failed to establish a regular payment history and document that he 
brought this debt current. It remains unresolved. (Item 1; AE A; AE B.) 

Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges Applicant is indebted to eight creditors in the 

 

 
2 

Applicant  was  delinquent  on  a  $17,986  second  mortgage  in  the  amount  of 
 
$2,295, as  alleged  in SOR  subparagraph 1.b.  He  presented a  letter  from this  creditor, 
dated March 15, 2015, which reflected this debt was paid in full on March 11, 2016. It is 
resolved. (Item 1; AE C.) 
 
 
Applicant was indebted on a charged-off credit card in the amount of $20,632, as 
alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.c. He presented a letter from this creditor, dated March 
9, 2013, which reflected this debt was paid in full. It is resolved. (Item 1; AE D.) 
 
 
Applicant was delinquent on an $11,935  vehicle loan in the amount of $618, as 
alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.d. Applicant presented a copy of a receipt for a check in 
the  amount  of  $710,  dated  April  29,  2016,  and  an  account  statement  that  shows 
Applicant’s loan was current as of March 30, 2016, with an unpaid balance of $7,422.50 
remaining on the loan. Applicant is current on this debt. (Item 1; AE E; AE F.)  
 
 
Applicant  is  indebted  on  a  charged-off  account  in  the  amount  of  $2,654,  as 
alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.e. He produced a written payment agreement with this 
creditor,  which  shows  he  agreed  to  make  monthly  payments  of  $100.  He  produced 
documentation that shows he made one $100 payment on May 14, 2016.  This debt is 
being resolved. (AE H.) 
 
 
Applicant is indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $530, as alleged 
in SOR subparagraph 1.f. Applicant produced no documentation that corresponds with 
this account. It is unresolved. (Item 5.) 
 
Applicant is indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $409, as alleged 
 
in  SOR  subparagraph  1.g.  Applicant  produced  a  letter  from  a  collection  agent  on  this 
account, which offered to settle this debt for a payment of $229.06. He failed to produce 
documentation  to  show  he  made  any  payments  to  the  creditor  under  this  agreement. 
(AE K.)  
 
 
Applicant  was  indebted  on  a  charged-off  account  in  the  amount  of  $289,  as 
alleged  in  SOR  subparagraph  1.h.  Applicant  presented  a  receipt  dated  May  20,  2016, 
which shows Applicant paid this debt. It is resolved. (AE J.) 
 
 
Applicant  attributed  his  delinquencies  to  a  reduction  of  hours  at  his  previous 
employer, his wife’s unemployment, and his current unemployment. He also noted that 
he was aiding his daughter with her university expenses. (AE A.) Applicant provided no 
recent household budget showing monthly household expenses, although an April 2013 
personal financial statement showed his expenses exceeded his income by more than 
$1,000 per month. (Item 3.) He did not provide a copy of his current earnings statement. 
Without updated information, I am unable to assess his current financial status, and his 
ability  or  willingness  to  repay  his  remaining  delinquent  debt  and  avoid  future 
delinquencies. The record lacks any evidence of credit or financial counseling.  
 
 
Under  Guideline  B,  the  SOR  alleges  Applicant’s  mother,  two  sisters,  and  three 
brothers  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Vietnam.  Applicant’s  mother  is  unemployed.  He 

 

 
3 

communicates  with  her  on  a  monthly  basis  by  phone  and  sees  her  yearly,  when  she 
visits  the  United  States.  One  of  Applicant’s  sisters  is  a  waitress,  and  the  other  is  a 
construction  helper.  Applicant’s  brothers  are  unemployed.  Applicant  has  not  seen  his 
siblings  in  person  since  1997.  He  communicates  with  them  approximately  once  per 
month.  None  of  his  relatives  in  Vietnam  is  employed  by  the  Vietnamese  government. 
His family members in Vietnam are not aware he has applied for a security clearance. 
(Item 3.)  
 
 
Vietnam is an authoritarian state ruled by the Communist Party of Vietnam. The 
Vietnamese Government arbitrarily arrests and detains individuals for political activities. 
The  Government  limits  freedom  of  speech,  religion,  and  the  press.  U.S.  citizens  have 
been detained after traveling in the area of closed borders with China, Cambodia, and 
Laos.  By  Vietnamese  law,  anyone  born  to  at  least  one  Vietnamese-citizen  parent  is 
considered to be a Vietnamese citizen. (Item 6.) 
 

Policies 

 

When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability 

 
the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 

for  a  security  clearance, 

These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the 
complexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in 
conjunction with the factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a), describing the adjudicative process. The 
administrative 
impartial,  and 
commonsense  decision.  According  to  AG  ¶ 2(c),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious 
scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The 
administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable  information  about  the  person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 

judge’s  overarching  adjudicative  goal 

is  a 

fair, 

 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to 
classified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this 
decision,  I  have  drawn  only  those  conclusions  that  are  reasonable,  logical,  and  based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  

 
Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish 
controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is 
responsible  for  presenting  “witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate, 
or  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The 
applicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  obtain  a  favorable  clearance 
decision.  

 
A  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary 
trust  and  confidence.  This 

the  Government  predicated  upon 

 
relationship  with 

 

 
4 

relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or 
safeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally 
permissible  extrapolation  as  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of 
classified information. 
 

Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national  interest  and  shall  in  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   

 

 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 

Analysis 

The  security  concern  for  Financial  Considerations  is  set  out  in  AG  ¶  18,  as 

follows:       
 

Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet 
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or 
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise 
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to 
protect  classified 
financially 
overextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under 

information.  An 

individual  who 

is 

AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 

(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 

 
 
Applicant  had  a  history  of  financial  delinquencies  that  he  had  been  unable  to 
resolve,  including  delinquent  debts  to  eight  creditors  in  the  approximate  amount  of 
$37,847,  as  alleged  in  the  SOR.  The  Government  established  the  disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶ 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating 
conditions is required.  
 
 
applicable:  

Five Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 

 
(a)  the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or  occurred 
under  such  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast 

 

 
5 

is 

the  cause  of 

doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good 
judgment; 
 
(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were  largely 
beyond  the  person’s  control  (e.g.,  loss  of  employment,  a  business 
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c)  the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the  problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e)  the  individual  has  a  reasonable  basis  to  dispute  the  legitimacy  of  the 
past-due  debt  which 
the  problem  and  provides 
documented  proof  to  substantiate  the  basis  of  the  dispute  or  provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 
Applicant has not acted responsibly, or in a timely manner, to attempt to resolve 
his remaining delinquent debt. His debt is current and on-going as demonstrated by the 
unresolved debts in SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.f, and 1.g. Applicant’s conduct does not 
warrant application of AG ¶ 20(a).  
 
Applicant’s debts, which were identified in the SOR, may have been due, in part, 
 
to his unemployment and underemployment and his wife’s unemployment. However, he 
also  made  the  decision  to  pay  for  his  daughter’s  university  education,  instead  of  his 
primary  mortgage  and  other  debts.  Further,  he  failed  to  demonstrate  responsible 
behavior  toward  those  accounts  that  remain  unresolved.  AG  ¶  20(b)  is  only  partially 
mitigating. 
 
 
Applicant  provided  no  evidence  of  the  depth  or  duration  of  any  financial 
counseling.  There  are  no  clear  indications  that  his  delinquent  debts  in  subparagraphs 
1.a,  1.f,  and  1.g  are  being  resolved  or  are  under  control.  Mitigation  under  AG  ¶  20(c) 
has not been established. 
 
 
Applicant  resolved  the  debts  in  subparagraphs  1.b,  1.c,  and  1.h,  and  is  making 
payments  toward  the  resolution  of  the  debts  in  subparagraphs  1.d  and  1.e.  Mitigation 
under AG ¶ 20(d) applies in part to the debts identified in subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 
1.e, and 1.h. 
 
 
AG  ¶  20(e)  requires  Applicant  to  provide  documented  proof  to  substantiate  the 
basis of any dispute or provide evidence of actions to resolve the issue. Applicant has 
not  provided  evidence  of  any  formal  dispute  or a basis for one.  Mitigation  under  AG  ¶ 
20(e) has not been established.

The  security  concern  relating  to  the  guideline for  Foreign  Influence  is  set  out  in 

Guideline B, Foreign Influence 
 
 
AG ¶ 6: 
 
Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual 
has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or 
induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a 
way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by 
any  foreign  interest.  Adjudication  under  this  Guideline  can  and  should 
consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or

States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a 
risk of terrorism. 

including,  but  not 

interest 

is 

located, 

limited 

 

The  guideline  notes  several  conditions  that could  raise  security  concerns  under 

AG ¶ 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   

 
(a)  contact  with  a  foreign  family  member,  business  or  professional 
associate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or  resident  in  a 
foreign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign 
exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and 
 
(b)  connections  to  a  foreign  person,  group,  government,  or  country  that 
create a potential conflict of interest between the individual’s obligation to 
protect  sensitive  information  or  technology  and  the  individual’s  desire  to 
help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. 
 
Applicant’s  mother  and  five  siblings  are  Vietnamese  citizens  and  reside  in  the 
  
Vietnam. Due to his ties to his family, and the threats present in Vietnam as set out in 
Item  6,  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign  exploitation,  inducement,  manipulation,  pressure, 
and  coercion  is  present.  The  evidence  is  sufficient  to  raise  the  above  disqualifying 
conditions. 
 
 
of the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 8 including: 
 

AG ¶ 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all 

(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which 
these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in 
that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be  placed  in  a 
position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, 
group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;  
 
(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual’s sense of 
loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is 
so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships 

 

 
7 

and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any 
conflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and 
 
(c)  contact  or  communication  with  foreign  citizens  is  so  casual  and 
infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign 
influence or exploitation. 
 
Applicant  maintains  relationships  with  his  mother  and  siblings,  who  are  citizens 
and residents of Vietnam. His contact with his mother is the most frequent. The Appeal 
Board has held that there is a rebuttable presumption that ties with immediate family are 
not  casual.1  The  evidence  shows  that  Applicant  maintains  his  relationship  with  his 
mother  during  the  year  through  phone  calls  and  her  annual  visits.  He  also  maintains 
regular contact with his siblings, although that contact is not as frequent as it is with his 
mother. While none of Applicant’s foreign family members are aware of his request for a 
security  clearance,  given  these  facts  and  Applicant's  close  ties  to  his  foreign  family 
members, I cannot confidently conclude that Applicant could not be placed in a position 
of having to choose between the interests of foreign individuals and the interests of the 
United States. AG ¶ 8 (a) and (c) do not apply. 

 
 Applicant  has  established  deep  and  longstanding  relationships  in  the  United 
States. He spent a formative part of his youth in the U.S and attended college here. He 
chose  to  stay  in  the  United  States  after  finishing  his  education.  He  became  a  U.S. 
citizen.  He  is  married  to  an  American  citizen.  His  children  are  U.S.  citizens.  Applicant 
can  be expected  to  resolve  any  conflict  of  interest  in favor  of  the  United  States.  AG  ¶ 
8(b) is mitigating. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 
Under  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 

the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of 
to 

the  conduct;  (2) 
the 
(1) 
circumstances  surrounding 
include  knowledgeable 
participation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the 
individual’s  age  and maturity  at  the  time  of the  conduct;  (5)  the  extent to 
which  participation 
the  presence  or  absence  of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 

the  conduct, 

is  voluntary;  (6) 

 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant  eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

I  considered  the  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  in  light  of  all 
facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guidelines F and B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. The Foreign 
Influence  concerns  related  to  Applicant’s  mother  and  siblings,  who  are  citizens  and 
residents  in Vietnam, are mitigated. However,  Applicant has not acted in a trustworthy 
manner  when  it  comes  to  addressing  his  financial  delinquencies.  There  is  insufficient 
evidence  to  demonstrate  that  recurrence  of  financial  irresponsibility  is  unlikely.  The 
potential for pressure, coercion, or duress remains undiminished. 

 
Overall,  the  record  evidence  leaves  me  with  questions  and  doubts  as  to 
Applicant’s  eligibility  and  suitability  for  a  security  clearance.  For  all  these  reasons,  I 
conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns.

HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 

 
On September 3, 2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons  (SOR)  to  Applicant  detailing  security  concerns  under  Guideline  F,  Financial 
Considerations.  The  action  was  taken  under  Executive  Order  10865,  Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review 
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines 
(AG) effective within the Department of Defense after September 1, 2006.  

  
On July 11, 2014, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a decision on the 
 
record. Department Counsel issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on July 7, 2015.  
Applicant received the FORM on  August 14, 2015. He had 30 days from his receipt of 
the  FORM  to  submit  additional  information  in  response  to  the  FORM.  Applicant 
requested  an  extension  until  October  19,  2015,  to  submit  matters  in  response  to  the 
FORM. His Response to the FORM and attached documents are admitted as Item  12. 
Department  Counsel  had  no  objection  to  Applicant’s  Response  to the  Form.  (Item  13) 
On November 5, 2015, the FORM was forwarded to the Hearing Office and assigned to 
me  on  November  9,  2015.  Based  upon  a  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and 
testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.

Findings of Fact 

 

In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits to all SOR allegations.  (Item 2)    

 
 
 
Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  employee  of  a  DOD  contractor  seeking  to  obtain  a 
security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since July 2011. Previously, 
he owned his own construction company from October 2007 to July 2011. He has been 
married and divorced twice. He is currently married to his third wife and has a five-year-
old son and a three-year-old daughter. He also has a stepson. (Item 3; Item 12)   

 
On  July  20,  2011,  Applicant  submitted  an  electronic  questionnaire 

for 
investigation  processing  (e-QIP).  (Item  3)  A  subsequent  background  investigation 
revealed  Applicant  encountered 
financial  problems.  Specifically,  Applicant  was 
approximately $95,326 past due on a mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.a: Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 2); he 
owed a $654 judgement entered against him in November 2009 on behalf of a hospital 
(SOR  ¶  1.b:  Item  6  at  1;  Item  7  at  1;  Item  9  at  1);  and  he  filed  for  bankruptcy  under 
Chapter  7  in  June  2010.  The  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  was  converted  to  a  Chapter  13 
bankruptcy. (SOR ¶ 1.c: Item 5 at 1; Item 6 at 1; Item 7 at 1; Item 10).   

 
In  his  response  to  the  SOR,  dated  December  11,  2014,  Applicant  admits  to  all 
allegations,  but  claims  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  are  included  in  his 
bankruptcy.    The  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  repayment  plan  required  him  to  pay  $164 
payments over a period of 60 months. Applicant indicated he is timely making payments 
and will continue to do so until the plan is complete in August 2015. (Item 2 at 6)  

 
In a response to Interrogatories, dated July 15, 2013, Applicant indicated that he 
filed for bankruptcy because of his divorce from his second wife in 2009 and as a result 
of business deal that went bad. He built seven houses for a contractor and was never 
paid.  He  believes  one  of  the  creditors  (a  mortgage)  included  in  his  bankruptcy  is  the 
same as the mortgage alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. (Item 4 at 9)  

 
Applicant  received  financial  counseling  as  a  requirement  of  his  bankruptcy 
process.  (Item  4  at  13,  25-29)  In  July  2013,  he  also  completed  a  personal  financial 
worksheet.  His  net  monthly  income  was  $2,851.  He  had  $2,297  in  total  monthly 
expenses. After expenses, he had $554 left over in discretionary income. (Item 4 at 22)  

 
In his response to the FORM, Applicant provided all of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy 
paperwork. He completed his payment plan and the Chapter 13 bankruptcy is complete. 
He  provided  a  copy  of  the  Discharge  of  Debtor  After  Completion  of  Chapter  13  Plan, 
dated  September  28,  2015.  He  provided  a  copy  of  his  payment  history.  He  also 
provided a portion of a TransUnion credit report which indicates the debt alleged in SOR 
¶  1.b  was  included  in  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy.  He  is  still  not  sure  where  the 
mortgage debt came from. It is no longer on his credit report and his attorney assures 
him that it was included in the bankruptcy. (Item 12)    

 

 
2 
 
 

He said he has made his share of mistakes, but has done everything he could to 
rectify  the  situation.    Everything  he  does  is  motivated  by  making  his  children’s  lives 
better.  He  explained  he  became  bankrupt  as  a  result  of  his  previous  job  in  the 
construction  business.  Applicant  built  houses.  His  business  partners  backed  out  when 
the real estate business slowed down and left Applicant with thousands of unpaid bills. 
At  the  same  time,  his  ex-wife  incurred  some  bills  that  he  could  not  afford  to  repay. 
Applicant is now able to pay his bills. His pay has increased an additional $8 an hour. 
(Item 12) 
   

Policies 

 

When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability 

 
the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially 
disqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  must  be  considered  when 
determining an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 

for  a  security  clearance, 

 
These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the 
complexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the 
factors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), 
the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the 
“whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. 

 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to 
classified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security.”  In  reaching  this 
decision,  I  have  drawn  only  those  conclusions  that  are  reasonable,  logical,  and  based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  

 
Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish 
controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is 
responsible  for  presenting  “witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate, 
or  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.  .  .  .”  The 
applicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  as  to  obtaining  a  favorable  security 
decision.  

the  Government  predicated  upon 

 
A  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary 
relationship  with 
trust  and  confidence.  This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or 
safeguard  classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally 

 
3 
 
 

permissible  extrapolation  as  to  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of 
classified information. 

  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the  national  interest  and  shall  in  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   

 

 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 

 

Analysis 

The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 

out in AG & 18:       
 

Failure  or  inability  to  live  within  one=s  means,  satisfy  debts,  and  meet 
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or 
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise 
questions  about  an  individual=s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to 
protect  classified 
financially 
overextended  is  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate 
funds.  

information.  An 

individual  who 

is 

 

The  guideline  notes  several  disqualifying  conditions  that  could  raise  security 
concerns. I find AG &19(a) (an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and AG &19(c) 
(a  history  of  not  meeting  financial  obligations)  apply  to  Applicant’s  case.  Applicant 
encountered  financial  problems  since  2008,  which  resulted  in  a  bankruptcy  filing  in 
2010.   
 
An  individual  who  is  financially  irresponsible  may  also  be  irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified information. Behaving 
irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in 
other  aspects  of  life.  A  person’s  relationship  with  his  creditors  is  a  private  matter  until 
evidence  is  uncovered  demonstrating  an  inability  or  unwillingness  to  pay  debts  under 
agreed  terms.  Absent  evidence  of  strong  extenuating  or  mitigating  circumstances,  an 
applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk 
inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be 
debt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial 
obligations.  

 
The  Government’s  substantial  evidence  and  Applicant’s  own  admissions  raise 
security  concerns  under  Guideline  F.  The  burden  shifted  to  Applicant  to  produce 
evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  the  security  concerns.  (Directive 
¶E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden 
of  disproving  it  never  shifts  to  the  Government.  (See  ISCR  Case  No.  02-31154  at  5 
(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005))  

 
4 
 
 

The  guideline  also  includes  examples  of  conditions  that  could  mitigate  security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially 
apply:  
 
AG  &  20(a)  (the  behavior  happened  so  long  ago,  was  so  infrequent,  or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast  doubt  on  the  individual’s  current  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good 
judgment);  
 
AG  &  20(b)  (the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were 
largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or 
separation),  and 
the 
circumstances);  
 
AG  ¶  20(c)  (the  person  has  received  or  is  receiving  counseling  for  the 
problem  and/or  there  are  clear  indications  that  the  problem  is  being 
resolved or is under control);  

responsibly  under 

the 

individual  acted 

  

AG  &  20(d)  (the  individual  initiated  a  good-faith  effort  to  repay  overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts); and   

 

AG &20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of  the  past-due  debt  which  is  the  cause  of  the  problem  and  provides 
documented  proof  to  substantiate  the  basis  of  the  dispute  or  provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue). 
 
Applicant’s  financial  problems  were  caused  by  a  business  downturn  and 
expenses  related  to  his  divorce  from  his  second  wife  in  2009.  His  business  partners 
broke their agreements with Applicant during the real estate downturn, leaving Applicant 
with thousands of unpaid bills. He attempted to resolve the situation on his own until he 
determined  he  had  no  option  other  than  bankruptcy.  He  successfully  completed  his 
payment plan under Chapter 13 and his debts were discharged in September 2015. His 
salary  has  increased  an  additional  $8  per  hour  and  he  is  able  to  pay  his  bills.  His 
financial  problems  are  unlikely  to  recur  and  no  longer  cast  doubt  on  his  reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) apply.  

 
AG & 20(c) applies. Applicant was required to attend financial counseling as part 
of  his  bankruptcy.    He  completed  financial  counseling  as  well  as  the  terms  of  his 
Chapter 13 repayment plan. Applicant’s financial situation is now under control.  

 
AG & 20(d) applies because Applicant demonstrated he made a good-faith effort 
towards  resolving  his  delinquent  accounts.    He  completed  his  Chapter  13  repayment 
plan.  All  payments  were  made  on  a  timely  basis.    AG  &  20(e)  is  applicable  because 
Applicant disputed the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, claiming they were part of 

 
5 
 
 

his  bankruptcy.  The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  was  verified  to  be  a  part  of  his 
bankruptcy. The mortgage debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a is no longer on his credit report.  

 
Applicant  resolved  any  doubts  raised  by  his  financial  situation.  He  successfully  

demonstrated that his financial situation is under control.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 
Under  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct  and  all  the  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the  nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 

the  conduct, 

is  voluntary;  (6) 

the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of 
to 

the  conduct;  (2) 
the 
(1) 
include  knowledgeable 
circumstances  surrounding 
participation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the 
individual’s  age  and maturity  at  the  time  of the  conduct;  (5)  the  extent to 
which  participation 
the  presence  or  absence  of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 
Under  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  ultimate  determination  of  whether  to  grant  eligibility  for  a 
security  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. 
        

I  considered  the  potentially  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  in  light  of  all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered several circumstances 
beyond  Applicant’s  control  adversely  affected  his  finances,  including  divorce  and  the 
real estate downturn that adversely affected his construction business. He successfully 
completed  his  Chapter  13  repayment  plan  and  his  financial  situation  has  stabilized. 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns raised under financial considerations.

APPEAL BOARD DECISION

APPEARANCES

FOR GOVERNMENT

James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel

FOR APPLICANT

Pro se

The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On
October 17, 2014, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant  requested a hearing.
On  November  21,  2015,  after  the  hearing,  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA)
Administrative  Judge  Francisco  Mendez  denied  Applicant’s  request  for  a  security  clearance.
Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.

Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge’s adverse decision was

arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.

The Judge’s Findings of Fact

The Judge made the following findings pertinent to the issues raised on appeal.  Applicant
has been continuously employed since 2004 and has held a clearance since 2008.  He owes the IRS
about  $40,000  for  unpaid  taxes  from  tax  years  2005  through  2012  and  for  2014.1    Applicant
attributed his tax problems to his having spent funds on a wedding rather than his taxes, as well as
to inadequate withholding.  Over the past several years Applicant has entered into a number of
installment agreements with the IRS.  When he is unable to pay, he contacts the IRS and negotiates
a new agreement.  Applicant has resolved other debts alleged in the SOR.  He has about $700 in
discretionary income each month.  His budget does not show any payments to the IRS.

The Judge’s Analysis

The Judge cleared Applicant of all SOR debts except those pertaining to his delinquent taxes.
He noted that Applicant has been fully employed for many years but has consistently failed to pay
his taxes in full.  The Judge noted that Applicant did not pay his 2014 taxes, which would have
become due after the receipt of the SOR.  The Judge concluded that not even the possible loss of a
security clearance could motivate Applicant to change his financial habits.

Discussion

Applicant cites to evidence that he has resolved other SOR debts.  He also points to his latest
repayment plan that, he argues, will enable him to resolve his tax delinquencies.  Applicant’s
argument is not sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in
the record.  Neither is it sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06093 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 4,
2015).  

1The SOR alleged tax debts up through tax year 2011.  The Judge stated that he was considering the non-alleged

debts only in evaluating Applicant’s case for mitigation and the whole-person factors.  Decision at 3, note 7.  

2

Applicant requests an opportunity to present us with additional information about his budget,
payments to the IRS, and resolution of other debts.  His brief also refers to matters from outside the
record.  We are not able to consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  Applicant notes
that the attorney who represented him at the hearing had requested the Judge not to consider several
pages of the transcript due to a malfunction with the video-teleconference equipment.  The Judge
stated that he did not consider these pages.  Decision at 2, note 6.  Therefore, any technical problem
that may have occurred did not impair Applicant’s receipt of due process.  

The Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the
decision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general standard is that a clearance may
be granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’”  Department
of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b):  “Any doubt
concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor
of the national security.”

The Decision is AFFIRMED.

Decision

______________

MOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:

On August 19, 2015, the Department of Defense (DoD)  issued a Statement of
Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F  for Applicant. (Item
1.)  The  action  was  taken  under  Executive  Order  10865,  Safeguarding  Classified
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense
Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review  Program
(January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG)
effective within the Department of Defense after September 1, 2006. 

 
On September 12, 2015, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he
requested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 1.)
On  October  27,  2015,  Department  Counsel  issued  the  Department's  written  case.  A
complete  copy  of  the  file  of  relevant  material  (FORM)  was  provided  to  Applicant  on
November  4,  2015.  In  the  FORM,  Department  Counsel  offered  six  documentary
exhibits. (Items 1-6.) Applicant was given the opportunity to file objections and submit
material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A response was due by December 10,
2015. Applicant submitted additional evidence, which has been identified and entered
into  evidence  as  Items  A  through  G.  The  case  was  assigned  to  this  Administrative

1

Judge on January 5, 2016. Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, eligibility
for access to classified information is denied.

Findings of Fact

After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the  evidence  in  the  record,  including
Applicant's RSOR and the FORM, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make
the following findings of fact: 

Applicant  is  46  years  old,  and  he  is  married  and  has  4  children.  He  earned  a
Bachelor’s  degree  in  1994.  Applicant  has  been  employed  since  2010  as  a  Computer
Operator by his current employer,  a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security
clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector. (Items 2, F.)

Guideline F, Financial Considerations

The  SOR  lists  five  allegations  (1.a.  through  1.e.)  regarding  financial  difficulties,
specifically  delinquent  debts,  under  Adjudicative  Guideline  F.  The  allegations  will  be
discussed below in the same order as they were listed on the SOR:

1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount
of $518.  In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. In his Post-FORM letter,
Applicant wrote that this debt had been paid off. Applicant also included a letter from the
creditor indicating that they would accept three monthly payments of $104.48 to settle
this debt. (Item A.) Item E shows that the creditor made an arrangement with Applicant
to debit electronically $104.48 from Applicant’s account on September 11, 2015, for this
debt.

1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a judgement filed against Applicant
in  April  2009,  in  the  amount  of  $14,892.    In  his  RSOR,  Applicant  admitted  this  SOR
allegation,  and  he  wrote  that  he  was  unable  to  negotiate  at  this  time.  (Item  1.)  In  his
Post-FORM letter, Applicant wrote that this judgment debt had been placed with a law
firm that informed Applicant a portion of his wages would be garnished bi-weekly for the
next  six  months.  (Item  A.)  Items  F  and  G  show  that  $357.73  was  deducted  from  the
paycheck of Applicant on November 29, 2015.  No evidence was introduced to establish
the total amount that has been deducted from Applicant’s pay or how much is still owing
on this debt. 

1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount
of $2,506. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. (Item 1.) In his Post-
FORM letter, Applicant wrote that he is currently on a payment schedule for this debt to
pay $156.25 a month until this debt is resolved. (Item A.) Item E shows that Applicant
has  made  one  payment  of  $163.75  on  September  14,  2015,  and  two  payments  of
$156.25 on October 14, 2015, and November 17, 2015, toward this debt.

1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount
of $5,649. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. (Item 1.) In his Post-

2

FORM letter, Applicant wrote that he is currently on a payment schedule for this debt to
pay $187.90 a month until this debt is resolved. (Item A.) Item D shows that Applicant
has made three payments of $187.90 on September 28, 2015; October 26, 2015; and
November 23, 2015; and three additional payments of $104.48.

1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for a collection account in the amount
of $3,677.  In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. (Item 1.) In his Post-
FORM letter, Applicant wrote that he is currently on a payment schedule for this debt to
pay $155 a month until this debt is resolved. (Item A.) Item C shows that Applicant has
made two payments of $155 on October 26, 2015, and November 23, 2015, toward this
debt.

Applicant  completed  an  Electronic  Questionnaires  for  Investigations  Processing
(e-QIP) on July 26, 2011, and he explained each of his delinquent debts, writing, “In Year
2008, had difficulty paying bills due to being laid off at 2  job due to company file [sic]
bankruptcy.”  (Item  2.)  As  reviewed  above,  Applicant  began  working  at  his present
employment in 2010, but he gave no explanation for why he did not begin attempting to
resolve his debts until  2015, after the SOR was issued.

Policies

When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability 

the
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition
to  brief  introductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list
potentially  disqualifying  conditions  and  mitigating  conditions,  which  are  useful  in
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.

for  a  security  clearance, 

These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the
complexities  of  human  behavior,  these  guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  the
factors  listed  in  the  adjudicative  process.  The  administrative  judge’s  over-arching
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c),
the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the
“whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a
decision.

The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b)
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have
drawn  only  those  conclusions  that  are  reasonable,  logical  and  based  on  the  evidence
contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere
speculation or conjecture.

Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish
controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  Applicant  is
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.  .  .  .”  The

3

Applicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  as  to  obtaining  a  favorable  security
decision. 

A  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk
the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  protect  or  safeguard  classified
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as
to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of
the  national  interest and  shall in no  sense be  a determination  as  to the  loyalty  of  the
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites
for access to classified or sensitive information).  

Guideline F, Financial Considerations

Analysis

The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set

out in AG ¶ 18:  

      Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,  lack  of  judgment,  or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and  regulations,  all  of  which  can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 

The  guideline  notes  several  conditions  that  could  raise  security  concerns  and
could potentially apply in this case.  Under AG ¶ 19(a), “an inability or unwillingness to
satisfy  debts,”  is  potentially  disqualifying.  Similarly  under  AG  ¶  19(c),  “a  history  of  not
meeting  financial  obligations,”  may  raise  security  concerns.  I  find  that  both  of  these
disqualifying  conditions  apply  to  Applicant  in  this  case.  The  evidence  has  established
that Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt several years ago.  

AG ¶ 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial
difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(b), it may be mitigating where, “the conditions that resulted in
the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment,
a  business  downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  or  a  death,  divorce  or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” As reviewed
above,  some  of  Applicant’s  financial  difficulties  occurred  as  a  result  of  his  periods  of
unemployment. However, since Applicant has been employed by his current employer
since 2010, and only began making payments toward the SOR debts after the SOR was

4

issued in 2015, I find that Applicant has not acted responsibly. Accordingly, I find that this
mitigating condition is not applicable in this case. 

¶  20(d)  is  now  applicable  but  not  controlling,  since  Applicant  has  begun  taking
action to “initiate a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve
debts,”  because  even  though  he  has  been  working  at  his  present  employment  since
2010,  he  did  not  begin  this  process  until  after  the  SOR  was  issued  in  2015.  To  be
applicable and controlling in the future, Applicant must establish a consistent history of
continuing  to  resolve  these  delinquent  past  debts  and  not  become  past  due  on  his
present debts. At this time, I find Guideline F against Applicant.

Whole-Person Concept

Under  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s
conduct  and  all  the  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the  nine
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 

the  conduct, 

to 

(1)  the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of  the  conduct;  (2)  the
circumstances  surrounding 
include  knowledgeable
participation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to
which  participation 
the  presence  or  absence  of
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation
for  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

is  voluntary;  (6) 

Under AG ¶ 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a
security  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      

I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the
facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited above
as to why the mitigating conditions are not applicable at this time, I find that the record
evidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and
suitability  for  a  security  clearance  under  the  whole-person  concept.  For  all  these
reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns under the whole-
person concept. 

Formal Findings

Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as

required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion

In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not
clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for  a  security
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.

For Applicant: Mark S. Zaid, Esq. 

 

HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) alleges two allegations under Guideline 
 
K  (handling  protected  information)  and  five  allegations  under  Guideline  E  (personal 
conduct).  All  allegations  relate  to  his  handling  of  confidential  data  in  December  2007 
and January 2008 and his participation in the follow-up investigation in 2009 and 2010. 
Applicant was assured that “trusted downloads” provided by the Navy and Company L 
did not contain classified information, when two of them contained a mix of unclassified 
and  classified  information.  Applicant  and  his  team  members  transferred  the  trusted 
downloads onto computers that were for unclassified use only. There was no evidence 
that any of the classified information was viewed by anyone not authorized to view it. 
Applicant made some judgment errors in his reaction to the discovery of the classified 
information. In March 2008, Applicant’s attorney offered to provide requested materials 
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); Applicant cooperated with the investigation; 
and  Applicant’s  errors  in  judgment  are  not  recent.  He  credibly  assured  conscientious 
compliance with security rules. He presented a strong case of whole-person mitigation. 
Security concerns are mitigated. Access to classified information is granted.      
  

History of the Case 

 

 
On  February  11,  2011,  Applicant  completed  and  signed  an  Electronic 
Questionnaires  for  Investigations  Processing  (e-QIP)  (SF  86).  (Government  Exhibit 
(GE)  1)  On  August  18,  2014,  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order 

 
1 
                                         
 

(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 
20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006. 

 
The  SOR  detailed  reasons  why  the  DOD  CAF  could  not  make  the  affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or  continue  a  security  clearance  for  Applicant  and  recommended  referral  to  an 
administrative  judge  to  determine  whether  a  clearance  should  be  granted,  continued, 
denied,  or  revoked.  (Hearing  Exhibit  (HE)  2)  Specifically,  the  SOR  set  forth  security 
concerns arising under Guidelines K and E.   

  
On  September  2,  2014,  Applicant  responded  to  the  SOR,  and  he  requested  a 
hearing.  On  July  23,  2015,  Department  Counsel  was  ready  to  proceed.  On  July  30, 
2015,  the  case  was  assigned  to  me.  On  November  12,  2015,  the  Defense  Office  of 
Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA)  issued  a  notice  of  hearing,  setting  the  hearing  for 
December 14, 2015. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. On December 7, 2015, 
Department  Counsel  moved  to  amend  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  There  was  no 
objection,  and  I  granted  the  motion.  During  the  hearing,  Department  Counsel  offered 
seven  exhibits,  which  were  admitted  into  evidence  without  objection,  and  Applicant 
offered  18  exhibits,  which  were  admitted  without  objection.  (Transcript  (Tr.)  17-21; 
Government  Exhibit  (GE)  1-7;  Applicant  Exhibit  (AE)  A-R)  On  December  22,  2015,  I 
received a transcript of the hearing.   

  

Findings of Fact 

 

 
In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  denied  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  Applicant 
admitted the information in amended SOR ¶ 1.b. Applicant’s admissions are accepted 
as findings of fact.  
 

Applicant is a 56-year-old software engineer employed by Company D, a defense 
contractor from 1980 to 2007. (Tr. 179, 214; AE A) From 2008 to present, he has been 
employed by another defense contractor. (AE A) In January 2011, Applicant’s security 
clearance was suspended. (GE 2; AE E)  

 
In 1998, Applicant married. (Tr. 235) His spouse is a missile engineer, and she 
has a security clearance. (Tr. 216) He has two daughters who are 14 and 15. (Tr. 215) 
His  father  was  a  career  Navy  officer.  (Tr.  215)  His  two  older  brothers  served  in  the 
Navy. (Tr. 215) His nephew was a Navy Seal, who served three tours in Afghanistan. 
(Tr. 215) Applicant never served in the military. (Tr. 235) 

 
Company D funded Applicant’s college tuition, and in 1982, Applicant received a 
bachelor  of  science  degree  in  mathematics.  (Tr.  178-179,  235;  AE  A)  After  1982, 
Applicant worked on a variety of Navy contracts for Company D.  Sometimes he was 
employed at Company D, but detailed to work on Company L managed projects. (Tr. 
180) During Desert Shield, he was deployed for six months to the Persian Gulf aboard a 
U.S. Navy vessel. (Tr. 180) 

 
2 
                                         
 

In 1999, Applicant was one of the architects of a program for a simulation test of 
part of a weapons system developed by Company L by utilizing unclassified data. (Tr. 
184;  GE  5;  GE  6)  From  1999  to  2007,  Applicant  was  instrumental  in  the  program 
development. (Tr. 184-189). In November 2007, Applicant went to the Pentagon, and in 
the  presence  of  an  admiral,  was  shown  some  design  charts,  which  Applicant  had 
developed on behalf of Company D, and Company L had previously presented without 
authorization to the Navy. (Tr. 189) Applicant believed the information was improperly 
taken from Company D by Company L.  

 

Handling Protected Information and Personal Conduct1  

 
Applicant was the leader of a team of technicians working on a Navy project. (Tr. 
99; GE 5 at 1-2) On about 75 occasions over several years, Company L employees or 
Navy personnel provided “trusted downloads” on flash drives or compact discs, which 
were supposed to be unclassified data or software that Applicant and his team could 
use  for  analysis.  (Tr.  94,  99-103;  GE  6  at  7)  Technicians  were  concerned  that  a  file 
marked  unclassified  might  actually  contain  classified  data.  (Tr.  87)  The  only  way 
classified information could be placed on unclassified computers was through an error 
in  the  trusted-download  process,  or  a  deliberate  improper  transfer  of  classified 
information. (Tr. 78) Applicant was not authorized to make a trusted download, and he 
denied knowingly transferring classified information to an unclassified computer. (Tr. 78)  
There are eight or nine people that could have been responsible for entering data that 
was too close to the thresholds to be unclassified. (Tr. 214) 

 
Applicant’s team’s project utilized a classified version and an unclassified version 
of a computer program. The classified version used “a set of parameters, thresholds, 
which [were] put together along with the executable part of the program” to generate a 
“classified  result.”  (Tr.  100,  107)  The  classified  numbers  changed  as  the  project 
advanced.  (Tr.  122-123)  M  was  a  key  person  in  deciding  whether  data  should  be 
classified or not. (Tr. 128) The unclassified version of the program used numbers that 
were not representative of the real system to simulate interactions, which allowed use of 
laptops and communications in an unclassified environment and improved productivity. 
(Tr. 100-101, 107) The non-representative numbers were used “to test the mechanics of 
the  program”  and  debug  problems  in  an  unclassified  environment.  (Tr.  108)  The 
classified numbers were not supposed to be used on unclassified computers. (Tr. 112) 
M assumed the computer he was issued was from Company L and not from DOD. (Tr. 
113) The unclassified versions could be used at home. (Tr. 100-102) Employees were 
allowed to use company-issued computers for some personal use; however, extensive 
personal use was discouraged. (Tr. 124) At Company L, if a spillage was discovered, 
Company L’s facility security officer (FSO) was supposed to be notified. (Tr. 115) The 
FSO was responsible for ensuring the file was deleted from computers. (Tr. 116) After 
deletion of the file, security used a cleaning program to scramble the computer memory. 

                                            

1Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this section is a December 16, 2010, 
letter from an FBI special agent written to the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) about 
the investigation of Applicant for unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material 
in possible violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1924. (GE 3)   

 
3 
                                         
 

(Tr.  116)  Applicant  had  access  to  classified  versions  of  the  program  and  classified 
program data. (Tr. 118) 

 
Employees  of  Companies  D  and  L  sought  to  maintain  separation  between  the 
classified  and  unclassified  versions.  (Tr.  101,  106-108)  In  2008,  the  security  people 
interviewed employees and borrowed computers with the programs on their computers 
to check for a data spill. (Tr. 102) Security found files containing classified information 
on the computers of four to seven employees of Company L, including on M’s computer. 
(Tr.  102-103,  118-121)  Security  performed  cleansing  operations  on  the  computers  to 
eliminate  the  files  with  classified  information.  (Tr.  102-103,  118-121)  Because  of  the 
spillage,  the  whole  unclassified-simulation  program  was  terminated,  and  all  future 
simulation work was done on the classified side. (Tr. 119, 124) Team members worked 
on  different  areas  of  the  program.  (Tr.  104-105)  Their  work  would  be  subsequently 
merged,  which  could  cause  classified  data  to  be  unknowingly  transferred  from  one 
computer to another, and no one would know the origin of the classified information. (Tr. 
104-105)      

 
4 
                                         
 

 
In December 2007, Applicant received a trusted download onto a flash drive from 
the  Navy  for  evaluation  of  Applicant  and  his  team.  (Tr.  221;  GE  5;  GE  6)  The 
information was supposed to unclassified. Classified files from downloads were labeled 
with a C, and unclassified files from trusted downloads were labeled with a T for test. 
(Tr. 192) In December 2007, B, a GS-13, who was the senior Navy employee on the 
team,  was  at  Applicant’s  residence,  when  they  were  doing  some computer  work.  (Tr. 
92, 192) Applicant inserted a flash drive into B’s laptop computer and was surprised to 
see a file starting with a C, which meant the file could be classified. (Tr. 193, 217-218; 
GE 5 at 2) Applicant had previously transferred the data from the flash drive to his DOD-
issued laptop computer without noticing the C-file. (Tr. 217) Applicant and B reviewed 
the content of the C-file and determined it was too “inchoate” and lacked a specification 
to  be  classified.  (Tr.  193)  Nothing  inside  the  C-file  was  marked  classified,  and  the 
content of the C-file never made it into a specification. (Tr. 193-194)  

 
In  December  2007,  the  information  from  the  flash  drive  would  have  been 
classified; however, by 2015, it was clear that at most it was sensitive information. (Tr. 
194, 220; GE 5 at 2) In 2007, the classification level for the data found on Applicant’s 
computer  was  probably  confidential.  (GE  6 at  4)  B  and  Applicant  agreed  that  the file 
should be deleted, and B suggested that Applicant download a cleaning program to be 
sure  it  was  deleted.  (Tr.  193;  GE  4  at  2;  GE  6  at  2)  They  deleted  the  file.  (Tr.  162) 
Applicant obtained a cleaning program, which wipes out inactive files. (Tr. 195-196)2 It 
deletes files from the recycle bin. (Tr. 224) Applicant conceded it was bad judgment to 
delete  the  file  without  going  to  security.  (Tr.  195,  235)  Applicant  has  never  had  any 
security violations. (Tr. 195) Applicant did not disclose the possible transfer of classified 
information  to  an  unclassified  system  until  August  19,  2010  when  he  met  with  an 
                                            

2Applicant is not the only team member with a clearing program on his DOD-issued computer. C 
has a cleaning or deletion program on his computer. (Tr. 80) C understood that if classified information 
were  found  on  an  unclassified  computer  the  safest  reaction  is  to  delete  the  classified  information  to 
ensure its protection from loss or compromise. (Tr. 80-81) The spillage should  also be reported  to the 
FSO. (Tr. 85-86) 

Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA) and others for a proffer session. Applicant promised to 
report any spillage that occurs immediately to his company (FSO). (Tr. 214)   

 
On January 18, 2008, two employees of a rival defense contractor (Company L) 
told investigators that Applicant may be responsible for the unauthorized removal and 
retention of classified materials. (GE 4) 

 
On  January  28,  2008,  Company  D’s  FSO  called  Applicant  and  asked  him  to 
provide his two DOD-issued laptop computers to Company L. (Tr. 196, 229) One of the 
requested laptop computers was at Applicant’s home. (Tr. 197-199) The FSO did not 
explain why the computers were requested. (Tr. 199) Applicant said he would bring the 
computers the next day, and the FSO did not insist or demand that Applicant provide 
the computer sooner. (GE 6 at 6) Applicant did not believe there had been classified 
information on the laptop computers. (Tr. 200) Applicant said he deleted  some family 
pictures and other personal information that he did not want to release. (Tr. 139-140, 
162-163,  169-170,  202,  227-229)  On  January  29,  2008,  Applicant  turned  in  the  two 
laptop computers. (GE 6 at 2) 

 
In  early  February  2008,  Applicant  went  to  another  state  where  there  was  a 
computer  with  the  same  program.  Two  subject  matter  experts  (SMEs),  who  were 
associated with Applicant’s team, reviewed the “unclassified data” on the hard drive and 
determined  that  there was  probably  classified  data  on  the  computer.  (Tr.  76-77,  205, 
213;  GE  6  at  2-3)  Most  of  the  information  was  unclassified;  however,  the  classified 
information  was  one  table  of  numbers  or  parameters,  and  none  of  the  SMEs  were 
aware  of  how  the  classified  table  had  migrated  from  the  classified  system  to  the 
unclassified  system.  (Tr.  77,  88,  90,  213,  232-233)  In  February  2008,  Applicant 
contacted Company D’s FSO and advised her of the possibility of confidential data on 
team computers. The computers were collected to detect any spillage. (Tr. 205-206; GE 
6 at 4) One of the SMEs also contacted his FSO about the possible spillage. (Tr. 206)   

 
Applicant  consulted  a  Navy  captain,  who  advised  Applicant  to  seek  the 
assistance of counsel, and in February 2008, he hired a counsel with significant national 
security  experience.  (Tr.  203;  GE  5  at  2;  GE  6  at  4;  AE  M)  On  March  4,  2008, 
Applicant’s  counsel  disclosed  to  the  FBI  that  Applicant  deleted  the  Company  D 
proprietary files because Company L had requested the computers. (AE B at 2-3)  

 
After receipt of the first two computers, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service 
(NCIS)  and  FBI  wanted  to  check  a  laptop  computer  and  a  desk  top  computer  in 
Applicant’s  possession  for  spillage.  NCIS  requested  the  two  computers  in  February 
2008. (Tr. 141; AE B) Applicant had saved tax returns and other personal information on 
the  desktop  computer.  The  desk  top  computer  was  obsolete  and  lacked  sufficient 
computer  power  to  run  simulations,  and  Applicant  believed  it  had  no  risk  of  having 
classified data on it. (Tr. 210) Applicant’s attorney wanted to find out whether the two 
computers were owned by Applicant, Company D, or DOD before providing them to the 
FBI  or  NCIS.  (Tr.  141)  With  the  assistance  of  Company  D,  Applicant’s  attorney 
determined  the  two  computers  were  probably  owned  by  DOD.  On  March  4,  2008, 
Applicant’s  attorney  wrote  the  FBI  volunteering  to  have  Applicant  provide  the  two 

 
5 
                                         
 

computers to the FBI. (Tr. 143-147, 164-165, 226; AE B; AE H) The FBI did not allege 
that  there  were  deletions  from  the  two  computers  Applicant  provided  in  March  2008; 
however, Applicant said the Company D proprietary information that he did not want to 
release to Company L was on the second set of computers provided to NCIS and the 
FBI. (Tr. 228-230) Applicant deleted the Company D proprietary information. (Tr. 228-
232) Applicant’s attorney disclosed to the FBI that she had retained a copy of the hard 
drive of the desktop computer in her office safe. (Tr. 144; AE B) The FBI never asked 
for the copy of the hard drive. (Tr. 144-145) There is no evidence that the FBI found any 
classified information on the two computers provided on March 4, 2008. (Tr. 172)       

 
Investigators checked some of the computers used in the project; however, they 
did  not  check  all  of the  other  computers  used  on the project  that  logically  might  also 
have spillage. (Tr. 79, 81, 88-89) C assumed that Company L was out to get Applicant 
because  of  how  he  was  targeted  by  the  investigation.  (Tr.  82-83)  The  FBI  did  not 
interview C. (Tr. 80) 

 
On August 19, 2010, Applicant and his counsel met with an AUSA and others for 
a proffer session. (Tr. 149) Applicant advised the FBI that Applicant had compact discs 
that he  received from  Company  L  with  trusted  downloads for  testing  simulations.  (Tr. 
156-159,  210,  212)  The  discs  were  marked  unclassified.  (Tr.  210)  Applicant  also 
disclosed  he  had  the  flash  drive  that  contained  the  C-file  that  he  downloaded  on  his 
computer in December 2007. (Tr. 222) He had previously deleted the C-file off of the 
flash drive. (Tr. 224) On August 23, 2010, Applicant provided the requested compact 
discs and flash drive to the NCIS. (Tr. 159, 170, 222; AE H)  

 
At  the  August  19,  2010  proffer,  AUSA,  an  FBI  special  agent,  and  two  NCIS 
special agents asked Applicant numerous questions about the computers, project, and 
classified  data.  (Tr.  150;  AE  C)  The  forensic  examination  determined  that  classified 
materials had been stored on one of the laptop computers. FBI SMEs, who were not 
related to Applicant’s team, reviewed the “classified values” and concluded 11 values 
were not sufficiently scrambled to render them unclassified. (Tr. 213; GE 3; GE 5 at 3; 
AE P) The classification level was deemed to be confidential. (AE L; AE P) Applicant 
believed the FBI SMEs erred in the manner that some of the numbers were “reverse 
engineered”  and  classified  as  confidential  or  secret.  (GE  6  at  5)  The  FBI  had  been 
relying  on  erroneous  information  from  SMEs,  and  the  FBI  SMEs  had  mistakenly 
confused some of the unclassified testing numbers with classified data. (Tr. 151, 154, 
211; GE 3) Applicant agreed with the FBI that one table contained classified numbers. 
(Tr.  151-154;  GE  5  at  2-3)  Applicant  conceded  his  unclassified  computer  should  not 
have  been  used  for  classified  information  because  it  did  not  contain  the  security 
measures required for storage of classified material. (Tr. 155-156)  

 
The AUSA appeared to accept that Applicant was involved in an inadvertent spill 
of  classified  numbers  as  opposed  to  a  deliberate  attempt  to  compromise  classified 
information. (Tr. 152) On December 16, 2010, an FBI special agent wrote the Defense 
Industrial  Security  Clearance  Office  (DISCO)  about  the  investigation  of  Applicant  for 
unauthorized  removal  and  retention  of  classified  documents  or  material  in  possible 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1924. (GE 3) The FBI letter advised that no charges would be 

 
6 
                                         
 

filed against Applicant; however, the allegations were referred to DISCO for appropriate 
action. The statute of limitations has now run, and prosecution is barred. (Tr. 153) 

 
From January 2008 to August 2010, the FBI and NCIS did not ask Applicant for 
any evidence. (GE 6 at 7) On March 4, 2008, Applicant’s attorney  wrote the FBI and 
offered  to  cooperate  with  the  FBI  investigation.  (AE  B)  Applicant’s  attorney  indicated 
Applicant was cooperative with the investigation. (Tr. 160)   
 
Character Evidence 
 
 
A Navy captain has known Applicant since the late 1990s and served with him on 
more than one tour at sea. (Tr. 26-27) He has reviewed the SOR and two of Applicant’s 
affidavits  related  to  the  SOR.  (Tr.  28-29;  GE  5;  GE  6)  He  described  Applicant  as  an 
“incredibly  gifted”  and  “incredibly  skilled”  technician.  (Tr.  29,  34)  He  is  “arguably  a 
genius” and exceptionally creative. (Tr. 34) On one occasion aboard a warship at sea, 
through  Applicant’s  diligent  and  inspired  efforts,  he  was  able  to  make  a  “great 
breakthrough”  with  the  operation  of  a  vital  weapons  system.  (Tr.  32)  Applicant  is 
conscientious about the protection of classified information. (Tr. 33) He recommended 
reinstatement  of  Applicant’s  security  clearance  through  the  top  secret  with  access  to 
sensitive compartmented information (TS/SCI) level. (Tr. 37-38)  
 
 
A  high-level  DOD  employee  with  TS/SCI  access,  who  has  oversight  authority 
over about 9,000 of DOD employees and a $300 million budget, traveled thousands of 
miles  at  his  own  expense  to  support  Applicant.  (Tr.  41-43,  52-53)  He  has  known 
Applicant  since  the  early  1990s.  (Tr.  43)  He  has  reviewed  the  SOR  and  two  of 
Applicant’s affidavits related to the SOR. (Tr. 44-45; GE 5; GE 6) Applicant occasionally 
discovered  design  flaws  with  Company  L’s  work,  and  some  Company  L  employees 
resented  Applicant.  (Tr.  48)  Applicant’s  comments  may  have  cost  Company  L  some 
award fees that might have otherwise been awarded by the Navy contracting officers. 
(Tr. 48) Applicant is intellectually gifted, talented, professional, and exceptionally diligent 
and dedicated to mission accomplishment. (Tr. 50-51) He recommended reinstatement 
of Applicant’s security clearance. (Tr. 55)  
 
 
A  program  director  on  a  project  has  known  Applicant  since  2003.  (AE  K) 
Applicant is open, candid, and honest. (AE K) Applicant was committed to the mission 
and U.S. national security interests. (AE K) He is aware of the SOR allegations. (Tr. 60, 
64-66)  Company  L  employees  were  having  difficulty  keeping  up  with  Applicant,  and 
Applicant  did  not  “endear  himself”  to  Company  L  when  he  stated  his  opinions  about 
Company  L’s  work.  (Tr.  66-67)  He  has  complete  confidence  in  Applicant’s  ability  to 
protect classified information and recommends reinstatement of his access to classified 
information. (Tr. 62, 69; AE K)  
   
The Navy has employed K for 30 years; he is a GS-15 with extensive expertise in 
 
issues;  and  he  has  known  Applicant 
simulations  and  security  classification 
professionally since the 1990s. (AE L) He performed the NCIS classification review of 
the  information  found  on  Applicant’s  laptop  computers  and  was  briefed  on  the 
investigation. (AE L; AE P) He concluded Applicant’s violations of security rules were

C has known Applicant since 1998, and worked with him in 2008. (Tr. 73-79; AE 
I)  C  has  experience  in  the  same  technology  as  Applicant.  (Tr.  76)  Applicant  has 
outstanding  integrity,  and  he  recommended  reinstatement  of  Applicant’s  access  to 
classified information. (Tr. 83-84)   
 
 
M  is  employed  at  Company  L,  and  he  worked  on  the  2007-2008  project  with 
Applicant.  (Tr.  99-100).  M  recommended  reinstatement  of  Applicant’s  security 
clearance. (Tr. 108, 163)  
 
 
An attorney with experience as a Defense Investigative Service (DIS) agent and 
substantial  experience  in  national  security  law  represented  Applicant  beginning  in 
February  2008.  (Tr.  131;  AE  M)  Applicant  waived  his  attorney-client  privilege,  which 
permitted  the  attorney  to  fully  discuss  Applicant’s  communications  to  her  and 
Applicant’s  willingness

the 

Policies 

  

The  U.S.  Supreme  Court  has  recognized  the  substantial  discretion  of  the 
Executive  Branch  in  regulating  access  to  information  pertaining  to  national  security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  528  (1988).  As  Commander  in  Chief,  the  President  has  the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is 
clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  do  so.”  Exec.  Or.  10865,  Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 

Eligibility  for  a  security  clearance  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the 
criteria  contained  in  the  revised  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  guidelines  are  not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines  are  applied  in  conjunction  with  an  evaluation  of  the  whole  person.  An 
administrative 
impartial,  and 
commonsense  decision.  An  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 

judge’s  overarching  adjudicative  goal 

  
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified  information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be

fair, 

 
8 
                                         
 

a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
This decision is not based, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination 
about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. Thus, any decision to deny a security 
clearance  is  merely  an  indication  the  applicant  has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  

 
 
Initially,  the  Government  must  establish,  by  substantial  evidence,  conditions  in 
the  personal  or  professional  history  of  the  applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of  establishing  controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  See  Egan,  484  U.S.  at  531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume  a  nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 

Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  or  continue  his  security 
clearance.”  ISCR  Case  No.  01-20700  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  19,  2002).  The  burden  of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 

Analysis 

 
Personal Conduct 
 

AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or 
unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations  can  raise  questions 
about  an  individual's  reliability,  trustworthiness  and  ability  to  protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and  candid  answers  during  the  security  clearance  process  or  any  other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
Two  personal  conduct  disqualifying  conditions  under  AG  ¶  16  are  potentially 

applicable. Those two disqualifying conditions provide:   

 
(d)  credible  adverse  information  that  is  not  explicitly  covered  under  any 
other  guideline  and  may  not  be  sufficient  by  itself  for  an  adverse 
determination,  but  which,  when  combined  with  all  available  information 
supports  a  whole-person  assessment  of  questionable 
judgment, 
untrustworthiness,  unreliability,  lack  of  candor,  unwillingness  to  comply 
with  rules  and  regulations,  or  other  characteristics  indicating  that  the 

 
9 
                                         
 

person  may  not  properly  safeguard  protected  information.  This  includes 
but  is  not  limited  to  consideration  of:  .    .    .  (3)  a  pattern  of  .  .  .  or  rule 
violations; and 
 
(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, 
that  creates  a  vulnerability  to  exploitation, manipulation,  or  duress,  such 
as  (1)  engaging  in  activities  which,  if  known,  may  affect  the  person's 
personal, professional, or community standing.  .  .  .   
 
AG ¶¶ 16(d) and 16(e) apply. Applicant violated rules in December 2007 when he 
discovered that he had downloaded possible classified information onto B’s computer 
and his own computer, and he failed to report this security breach to his FSO (SOR ¶ 
1.a).  

 
Applicant refuted the SOR allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.e. SOR ¶ 1.b. On 
January  28,  2008,  Company  D  asked  Applicant  to  return  two  computers;  however, 
Company D did not indicate it was necessary to return the computers that day. One of 
the computers was at Applicant’s home, and he had other errands to complete that day. 
Applicant provided the computers the next morning. He had a deletion program running 
on one of the computers. No rules were violated.  

 
SOR  ¶  1.c.  The  hard  drive  of  one  of  Applicant’s  computers  was  restricted  to 
unclassified information use, and it was found to contain some classified data. Applicant 
was  unaware  his  computer  contained  classified  information.  He  is not  responsible for 
“trusted  downloads,”  and  he  inadvertently  downloaded  classified  information  from  a 
trusted  download  onto  his  hard  drive.  In  February  2008,  he  reported  this  breach  to 
Company D’s FSO. He did not knowingly violate any rules. 

 
SOR ¶ 1.d. On March 4, 2008, Applicant’s attorney wrote the FBI that Applicant 
was willing to cooperate with the investigation. On August 19, 2010, during the AUSA 
proffer,  Applicant  mentioned  he  had  compact  discs  and  a  flash  drive  from  trusted 
downloads. Applicant did not believe they contained classified information. On August 
23, 2010, Applicant provided the compact discs and flash drive. There is no information 
that they contained classified information.   

 
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant had two computers that he provided to his attorney, 
and his attorney retained them as of December 2010. Applicant had four computers that 
were  requested  by  Company  D.  Two  were  requested  on  January  28,  2008,  and  he 
turned two of them into Company D on January 29, 2008. In February 2008, the NCIS 
and FBI requested two more computers. Applicant’s attorney wanted to find out whether 
the  two  computers  were  owned  by  Applicant,  Company  D,  or  DOD  before  providing 
them  to  the  FBI  or  NCIS.  On  March  4,  2008,  Applicant’s  attorney  wrote  the  FBI 
volunteering to have Applicant provide the two computers to the FBI. In March 2008, 
Applicant turned in the two computers to the NCIS around March 4, 2008.

Further analysis concerning applicability of mitigating conditions is required. The 
Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the applicability 
of mitigating conditions as follows:  

 
Once  a  concern  arises  regarding  an  Applicant’s  security  clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir.  1990),  cert.  denied,  499  U.S.  905  (1991).  After  the  Government 
presents  evidence  raising  security  concerns,  the  burden  shifts  to  the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard  applicable  in  security  clearance  decisions  is  that  articulated  in 
Egan,  supra.  “Any  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for 
access  to  classified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  the  national 
security.” Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 

ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  

 
Three mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 17 are potentially applicable:  
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely  to  recur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on  the  individual's  reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to  change  the  behavior  or  taken  other  positive  steps  to  alleviate  the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or  other  inappropriate  behavior,  and  such  behavior  is  unlikely  to  recur;  
and 
 
(e)  the  individual  has  taken  positive  steps  to  reduce  or  eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. 
 
AG ¶ 16(e) is mitigated by AG ¶ 17(e) because Applicant has fully disclosed his 
rule violations. Law enforcement, security officials, and his witnesses are well aware of 
his  security-related  conduct,  and he  is not  vulnerable  to  exploitation, manipulation,  or 
duress because of his security-related conduct. 

 
AG ¶¶ 17(c) and 17(d) apply. The only evidence of Applicant’s December 2007 
security breach was Applicant’s self-report; however, his self-report was not timely, as it 
appears  it  was  disclosed  at  his  August  19,  2010  AUSA  proffer.  However,  Applicant’s 
failure to report the December 2007 security breach is not recent; the security breach 
was  inadvertent;  “it  happened  under  such  unique  circumstances  that  it  is  unlikely  to 
recur;”  and  it  “does  not  cast  doubt  on  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  good 
judgment.”  He  admitted  that  he  showed  poor  judgment  in  December  2007  when  he 
discovered that he had downloaded possible classified information onto B’s computer 
and his own computer, and he failed to report this security breach to his FSO (SOR ¶ 

 
11 
                                         
 

1.a).  Security  needed  to  assess  the  scope  of  the  breach  of  security  or  spillage,  and 
security was unable to check other computers and determine who was responsible for 
the “trusted download” that caused the security breach.  

 
Applicant  understands  the  importance  of  informing  security  of  any  security 
breach or possible security breach, and I am confident he will timely disclosed required 
information. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated. Even if security concerns are not 
mitigated under Guideline E, they are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra. 
 
Handling Protected Information  
 
  
AG  ¶  33  articulates  the  security  concern  relating  to  handling  protected 
information  as  follows,  “Deliberate  or  negligent  failure  to  comply  with  rules  and 
regulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an 
individual’s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard 
such information, and is a serious security concern.” 

 
AG  ¶  34  provides  three  disqualifying  conditions  that  could  raise  a  security 

  
concern and may be disqualifying in this case:  
 

(b) collecting or storing classified or other protected information at home or 
in any other unauthorized location; 
 
(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise 
handling classified reports, data, or other information on any unapproved 
equipment including but not limited to any typewriter, word processor, or 
computer  hardware,  software,  drive,  system,  gameboard,  handheld, 
""palm"" or pocket device or other adjunct equipment; and 
 
(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other 
sensitive information. 

 

AG ¶¶ 34(b), 34(c), and 34(g) apply. These three disqualifying conditions do not 
include  a  requirement  that  Applicant  knew  he  was  downloading  classified  information 
onto  an  unclassified  system,  and  they  do  not  require  that  he  be  aware  that  his 
unclassified computer systems contain classified information.  

 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c discussed previously are cross-alleged under SOR ¶¶ 2.a 
and  2.c.  In  December  2007,  Applicant  discovered  that  he  had  downloaded  possible 
classified  information  onto  B’s  computer  and  his  own  computer.  The  two  computers 
were not authorized for storage of classified information.   

 
The hard drive of one of Applicant’s DOD-issued laptop computers was restricted 
to unclassified information use, and a forensic evaluation and SME review found that his 
laptop computer contained some data classified at the confidential level. Applicant was 
unaware  this  computer  contained  classified  information.  He  is  not  responsible  for 

 
12 
                                         
 

“trusted  downloads,”  and  he  inadvertently  downloaded  classified  information  from  a 
trusted download onto his hard drive.  

 
Three mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 35 are potentially applicable:  

 

(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so 
infrequently  or  under  such  unusual  circumstances,  that  it  is  unlikely  to 
recur  and  does  not  cast  doubt  on  the  individual's  current  reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security 
training and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of 
security responsibilities; and 
 
(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. 
  
AG ¶¶ 35(a) through 35(c) apply. As indicated in the previous section, AG ¶ 35(a) 
is  established.  The  particular  simulation  program  involving  inadvertent  transfers  of 
classified data to unclassified systems was changed to a completely classified system. 
Such  erroneous  “trusted  downloads”  will  not  recur.  Applicant  understands  how 
important it is to avoid future transfers of classified information to unclassified computer 
systems.  He  has  been  counseled  and  understands  that  when  a  security  violation  is 
discovered, it should be timely reported to his FSO. He has a positive attitude towards 
conscientiously complying with security requirements.  

 
Applicant’s  actions  since  March  2008  show  sufficient  effort,  good  judgment, 
  
trustworthiness,  and  reliability  to  warrant  mitigation  of  handling  protected  information 
security  concerns.  Even  if  handling  protected  information  concerns  are  not  mitigated 
under Guideline K, they are mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra.    

 

Whole-Person Concept 

 
 Under  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct  and all  the  circumstances. The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  

the  conduct, 

the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of 
to 

the  conduct;  (2) 
the 
(1) 
circumstances  surrounding 
include  knowledgeable 
participation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which  participation 
the  presence  or  absence  of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 

is  voluntary;  (6) 

 
13 
                                         
 

Under  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  ultimate  determination  of  whether  to  grant  eligibility  for  a 
security  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guidelines E and K in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors 
in AG ¶ 2(a)  were addressed under Guidelines  E and K, but some warrant additional 
comment. 

  
Applicant is a 56-year-old software engineer employed by Company D from 1980 
to 2007. From 2008 to present, he has been employed by another defense contractor. 
His spouse is a security clearance holder; his father was a career Navy officer; his two 
older brothers served in the Navy; and his nephew was a Navy Seal, who served three 
tours  in  Afghanistan.  In  1982,  Applicant  received  a  bachelor  of  science  degree  in 
mathematics.  During  Desert  Shield,  Applicant  was  deployed  for  six  months  to  the 
Persian Gulf aboard a U.S. Navy vessel.   

 
A Navy captain, who has known Applicant since the late 1990s; a high-level DOD 
employee, who has oversight authority over about 9,000 of DOD employees and a $300 
million budget and who has known Applicant since the 1990s; a program director on a 
project,  who  has  known  Applicant  since  2003;  two  contractors,  who  worked  with 
Applicant  on  the  project  at  issue;  and  Applicant’s  attorney  described  Applicant  in 
laudatory  terms.  Applicant  is  an  “incredibly  gifted,”  exceptionally  creative,  and 
“incredibly skilled” technician and engineer. He is diligent, intelligent, professional, open, 
candid, honest, and conscientious about the protection of classified information. Most of 
his  character  witnesses  were  aware  of  the  SOR  allegations,  had  read  Applicant’s 
statements in 2011 and 2013, and recommended reinstatement of Applicant’s security 
clearance.  

 
Applicant’s  SOR  allegations  relate  to  his  handling  of  confidential  information  in 
December  2007  and  January  2008  and  participation  in  the  follow-up  investigation  in 
2009  and  2010.  Company  L  or  Navy  employees  provided  “trusted  downloads”  to 
Applicant and his team. The trusted downloads were not supposed to contain classified 
data or software; however, there was some classified data mixed in with the unclassified 
data. Applicant and other members of his team unknowingly downloaded the classified 
and  unclassified  information  onto  computers  allocated  to  unclassified  information. 
Applicant  did  not  compromise  classified  information  as  there  is  no  evidence  the 
unclassified  computers  were  used  by  anyone  not  authorized  to  review  the  classified 
information. In December 2007, Applicant discovered possible classified information on 
his unclassified computer and on B’s computer. B and Applicant agreed that they should 
delete  it,  and  they  did  so.  This  error  was  aggravated  when  Applicant  and  B  failed  to 
disclose the discovery of the probable classified information on the flash drive and their 
computers  to  their  FSOs.  Applicant  did  not  receive  adequate  training  or  supervision 
from  B,  a  GS-13  Navy  employee  on  this  occasion.  There  was  no  evidence  that 
Applicant was told prior to December 2007 of the protocol after discovery of possible 
classified information on an unclassified computer.  

 
After  two  of  Applicant’s  assigned  DOD-issued  computers  were  requested,  he 
deleted Company D proprietary information and personal information before providing 

 
14 
                                         
 

one  computer  to  Company  D  and  one  computer to  NCIS. These deletions  raised  the 
possibility  that  he  was  intentionally  obstructing  the  investigation  because  forensic 
examination revealed there were deletions, but could not determine the content of the 
deletions.  Applicant  provided  the  only  evidence  of  the  content  of  the  deletions.  In 
February  2008,  after  Applicant  made  the  deletions,  he  hired  an  experienced  national 
security attorney who advised him to cooperate with the investigation. After March 2008, 
Applicant  cooperated  with  the  investigation,  and  his  attorney  notified  the  FBI  that  he 
would assist the investigation. His errors in judgment were made from December 2007 
through February 2008 and are not recent.   

 
Applicant’s hearing statement was credible. He understands what he needs to do 
to maintain his eligibility for access to classified information. He has avoided any hint of 
violation  of  his  employer’s  rules  or  security  rules  after  March  2008.  He  expressed 
sincere remorse for his infractions of security rules and errors in judgment in December 
2007  and  January  2008,  and  he  emphasized  his  determination  to  conscientiously 
comply  with  all  security  rules  and  requirements.  I  am  confident  he  will  continue  to 
conscientiously exercise his security responsibilities in the future. 

    
I  have  carefully  applied  the  law,  as  set  forth  in  Egan,  Exec.  Or.  10865,  the 
Directive,  and  the  AGs,  to  the  facts  and  circumstances  in  the  context  of  the  whole 
person.  Personal  conduct  and  handling  protected  information  concerns  are  mitigated, 
and eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  
 

Formal Findings 

Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 

as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          

 

Paragraph 1, Guideline E:     

 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:

In  light  of  all  of  the  circumstances  presented  by  the  record  in  this  case,  it  is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.

GARCIA, Candace Le’i, Administrative Judge: 

 
Applicant  mitigated  the  foreign  preference  and  foreign  influence  security 

concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  
 

Statement of the Case 

On  May  12,  2016,  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  issued  a  Statement  of 
Reasons  (SOR)  to  Applicant  detailing  security  concerns  under  Guideline  B  (foreign 
influence) and Guideline C (foreign preference). The action was taken under Executive 
Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance  Review  Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG). 

 
Applicant  responded  to  the  SOR  on  June  30,  2016,  and  requested  a  hearing 
before  an  administrative  judge.  The  case  was  assigned  to  me  on  May  4,  2017.  The 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 16, 
2017, scheduling the hearing for June 30, 2017.

marked as AE F and admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript 
(Tr.)  on  July  11,  2017.  Department  Counsel  and  Applicant  requested  that  I  take 
administrative notice of certain facts about Israel. The facts administratively noticed are 
summarized in the Findings of Fact, below. 
 

Findings of Fact 

 

Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  He  is  a  39-year-old  analyst 
employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  March  2015.  He  worked  for  a  prior  defense 
contractor,  at  a  U.S.  Embassy  overseas,  from  January  2008  to  February  2009.  He 
worked for another defense contractor from August 2010 to November 2012. He was 
granted eligibility for a public trust position by another federal agency in 2008. He was 
granted a DOD security clearance in 2014.1  

 
Applicant  is  a  native-born  U.S. citizen  and  resident. He  obtained  a  high-school 
diploma in the United States in 1996 and a bachelor’s degree from a U.S. university in 
2001. He was previously married from September 2009 to November 2010. As of the 
hearing, he was engaged to a native-born U.S. citizen. He does not have any children.2 

 
Applicant enlisted and served as an active duty infantryman in the Israeli military 
from November 2004 to February 2006. Upon completion of his service, he declined an 
offer to serve in the Israeli military reserves and was honorably discharged. His primary 
motivation for serving in the Israeli military was to develop the skills and experience that 
would assist him in furthering a career in security in support of the U.S. Government. He 
initially desired to serve in the U.S. military, but learned when he spoke to recruiters that 
he  was  ineligible  due  to  a  longstanding  medical  condition.  He  explored  alternative 
options  to  serve  the  U.S.  Government  through  security  positions  with  defense 
contractors  and  in  the  private  sector,  but  discovered  that  all  such  positions  required 
prior military experience. He did not inquire whether his medical condition would have 
disqualified him from holding these positions since he did not meet the requisite criteria 
of  prior  military  service.  He  did  not  explore  options  that  did  not  require  prior  military

experience because such positions would not have provided him with the opportunity to 
develop skills in his desired field.3   

 
Applicant discovered through internet research a program designed for overseas 
Jewish volunteers who had an interest in serving in the Israeli military, so long as one 
provided evidence of Jewish heritage. He decided then, at the age of 23, that it was a 
reasonable option for him to serve in the Israeli military given that the United States and 
Israel  were  allies  with  mutual  adversaries.  He  made  this  decision  on  his  own.  He 
discussed  his  decision  with  his  parents,  and  their  conversations  revolved  primarily 
around their concern for Applicant’s safety.4 

 
In  2004,  Applicant  traveled  to  Israel  to  join  the  Israeli  military.  Acting  on  the 
recommendation  that  he  have  a  basic  proficiency  of  Hebrew  prior  to  enlistment, 
Applicant  first  engaged  in  a  five-month  language  instruction  program.  The  language 
program  was  not  affiliated  with  the  Israeli  military.  He  subsequently  enlisted  and  the 
Israeli military sent him to additional language training.5  

 
During the enlistment process, Applicant lied and told the Israeli military that he 
did  not  have  the  medical  condition  that  rendered  him  ineligible  to  serve  in  the  U.S. 
military. He did so because he was told, at an initial enlistment meeting when he arrived 
in Israel, that his longstanding medical condition, combined with another of his medical 
conditions, would have lowered his physical profile to such a degree that would have 
disqualified  him  from  serving  as  an  infantryman.  He  was  previously  unaware  of  this 
information. He understood from his internet research prior to traveling to Israel that he 
would  be  permitted  to  serve  in  some  capacity  despite  his  medical  condition.  He  also 
understood that his medical condition was not necessarily a disqualifier for joining the 
infantry.6  

 
Applicant  determined  that  while  he  was  unwilling  to  lie  to  the  U.S.  military  and 
government about this particular medical condition, it was acceptable for him to lie to 
the  Israeli  military  and  government  since  he  did  not  have  any  allegiance  to  them.  He 
was not concerned his medical condition would be discovered because he managed it 
and  was  able  to  maintain  a  high  level  of  fitness.  He  disclosed  his  other  medical 
condition  and  medical  history to the  Israeli  military.  In the  13  years that  have  passed 
since his enlistment in the Israeli military, Applicant has matured. He understands now 
that he should have disclosed his longstanding medical condition to the Israeli military, 
even if such a disclosure would have prevented him from serving as an infantryman.7

Applicant’s  ex-girlfriend  resides  in  Israel.  He  met  her  on  an  online  dating  site 
when he attended the five-month language instruction program in Israel. He lived with 
her while he was serving in the Israeli military. He last communicated with her in 2007. 
When  Applicant  moved  back  to  the  United  States  from  Israel  in  2007,  he  had  social 
media contact with her. He also had social media contact with her one sister who also 
resides  in  Israel,  and  several  individuals  in  Israel  with  whom  Applicant  served  in  the 
Israeli  military,  to  include  his  unit  supervisor.  After  he  received  the  SOR,  Applicant 
deleted all of his foreign contacts on social media. He had not previously deleted them 
because  he  consulted  and  was  advised  by  a  former  colleague  that  doing  so  at  once 
might trigger to any one of his foreign contacts who might be working in the intelligence 
field that he was pursuing a sensitive position. He ultimately decided that since he was 
not  in  communication  with  any  of  his  foreign  contacts,  he  did  not  need  to  maintain  a 
social  media  connection  with  them.  Since  he  deleted  his  foreign  contacts  on  social 
media, some have tried to reconnect with him but Applicant has not responded and has 
no intentions of doing so.8 
  
 
Applicant maintains contact with one individual, a U.S. citizen and resident, with 
whom Applicant served in the Israeli military. This individual is the founder and CEO of 
a civilian national service organization that has no connections to the Israeli government 
or military. As an American Jew, this individual chose to serve in the Israeli military and 
did  so  for  two  years  in  the  same  unit  as  Applicant.  He  attested  that  both  he  and 
Applicant  were  low-level  infantrymen.  Since  their  discharge  from  the  Israeli  military, 
Applicant  and 
individual  see  each  other  once  yearly  and  communicate 
approximately twice yearly.9 
 
After  graduating  from  college  and  before  he  served  in  the  Israeli  military, 
 
Applicant took a trip to Israel in August 2002 through a birthright program. The program 
helped teach him about his Jewish culture. Subsequent to his Israeli military service and 
during a period of unemployment, he traveled to Israel in June 2010 through the same 
birthright  program.  On  this  occasion,  he  served  as  a  volunteer  male  counselor  to  the 
program.  He  did  not  see  any  of  his  former  Israeli  military  contacts  or  his  ex-girlfriend 
during this trip. Both trips were comprised of U.S. citizens, all Jewish Americans, who 
wanted  to  travel  to  Israel  to  learn  more  about  their  Jewish  culture.  He  has  not  since 
traveled  to  Israel.  Should  he  travel  to  Israel  or  any  foreign  country  in  the  future,  he 
understands  as  a  security  clearance  holder  the  requirement  to  report  such  foreign 
travel.10 
 
 
Applicant did not have an Israeli security clearance when he served in the Israeli 
military. He has never been an Israeli citizen, as he was not required to become one in 
order to serve in the Israeli military, and as such he has never held an Israeli passport. 
He chose not to become an Israeli citizen or obtain an Israeli passport because he did

not want to leave  any room for misinterpretation as  to where his loyalties lie. He has 
never voted in an Israeli election. He earned $6,000 yearly when he served in the Israeli 
military. He was required to open a bank account in Israel for the direct deposit of that 
income. He rented two apartments in Israel as he was required to maintain a home of 
record  during  the  course  of  his  Israeli  military  service.  Since  his  discharge  from  the 
Israeli military and move back to the United States, he has not received nor does he 
expect to receive any income or benefits from the Israeli government or military. He also 
closed his Israeli bank account.11  
 
 
Upon  his  discharge  from  the  Israeli  military,  Applicant  moved  back  to  and  has 
since lived in the United States. He resided with his parents from March 2006 through 
January 2008. He moved out of his parents’ home and rented at various locations from 
January 2008 until 2015. Since 2015, he and his fiancée have rented a place together.  
He was briefly unemployed from February to May 2006, and again from November 2012 
to  July  2013.  He  has  otherwise  worked  as  a  self-employed  security  consultant  or  a 
defense  contractor  as  previously  discussed.  Applicant  and  his 
fiancée  have 
approximately  $25,000  in  joint  savings.  Applicant  also  has  approximately  $50,000  in 
retirement assets in the United States. He does not have any assets in Israel.12 
 
 
Applicant  testified  that  his  prior  Israeli  military  service  cannot  be  used  against 
him,  as  his  family,  friends,  and  coworkers  are  aware  of  it.  His  parents,  sibling,  and 
fiancée are native-born U.S. citizens and residents. His father worked for many years 
for a defense contractor. His fiancée, who works for the U.S. Government and holds a 
DOD security clearance, testified that Applicant disclosed his Israeli military service to 
her  when  they  met  in  May  2014.  She  described  Applicant  as  passionate  about  the 
United  States.  Applicant’s  supervisor  also  testified  that  he  was  aware  of  Applicant’s 
prior Israeli military service and described Applicant as an exceptional performer, with 
no reason to question his character, integrity, or loyalty to the United States. Applicant 
also provided letters of support from his neighbor and mentor, both of whom were also 
aware of Applicant’s Israeli military service and who described Applicant as trustworthy 
and loyal to the United States.13

Defense, diplomatic, and economic cooperation between the United States and 
Israel has been close for decades. Strong bilateral relations have fueled and reinforced 
significant  cooperation  between  the  United  States  and  Israel  on  defense-related 
matters. Aid for Israel has been designed to maintain Israel’s qualitative military edge 
over neighboring militaries, since Israel must rely on better equipment and training to 
compensate for a manpower deficit in any potential regional conflict. However, U.S. aid 
to  Israel  is  not  unlimited.  Sales  of  U.S.  defense  articles  and  services  to  Israel  are 
subject to the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and the July 23, 1952, Mutual Defense

Assistance Agreement between the United  States and Israel. AECA enumerates the 
purposes  for  which  foreign  governments  can  use  U.S.  military  articles  and  limits  the 
ability of foreign governments to transfer U.S. military products to third party countries 
without the prior consent of the President of the United States. The 1952 agreement 
states  that  the  government  of  Israel  assures  the  United  States  government  that 
equipment, materials, or services acquired from the United States are required for and 
will  be  used  solely  to  maintain  Israel’s  internal  security  and  Israel’s  legitimate  self-
defense.  
 
 
Although the United States has provided regular military support to Israel, there 
is a significant documented history of classified information and controlled technologies 
being illegally imported to Israel. These include parts used in fighter jets, spy software, 
components  for  certain  missiles  and  fighter  jet  aircraft,  digital  oscilloscopes  that  are 
capable of being utilized in the development of weapons of mass destruction and  in 
missile  delivery  fields,  a  product  containing  a  certain  chemical  precursor  that  is 
controlled  for  chemical,  biological,  antiterrorism,  and  chemical  reasons,  pressure 
transducers  that  are  controlled  for  nuclear  non-proliferation  reasons,  encryption 
software  that  is  controlled  for  national  security  reasons,  and  classified  documents. 
Illegal  technology  transfers,  even  to  private  Israeli  entities,  are  a  significant  concern 
because  foreign  government  entities  have  learned  to  capitalize  on  private-sector 
technology acquisitions.  
 
 
In the past 30 years, there have been at least three cases in which employees 
of the U.S. Government were convicted of disclosing classified information to Israel or 
of  conspiracy  to  act  as  an  Israeli  agent.  Reports  indicate  that  concerns  regarding 
possible Israeli espionage persist among U.S. officials. The most prominent espionage 
case is that of Jonathan Pollard. He pled guilty in 1986, with his then wife, to selling 
classified documents to Israel. Israel granted Pollard, who is serving a life sentence in 
a U.S. federal prison, citizenship in 1996 and, in 1998, acknowledged that Pollard had 
been its agent. 
 
 
A  travel  warning  issued  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  for  Israel,  the  West 
Bank, and Gaza remains in effect, as the security environment remains complex due to 
heightened  tensions  and  security  risks.  U.S.  citizens  are  advised  that  all  persons 
entering or departing Israel, the West Bank, or Gaza are subject to security screening, 
and may be denied entry or exit. Israeli security officials have on occasion requested 
access  to  travelers’  personal  email  accounts  or  other  social  media  accounts  as  a 
condition  of  entry.  In  such  circumstances,  travelers  should  have  no  expectation  of 
privacy for any data stored on such devices or in their accounts. 
  

 

When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability 

 
the 
administrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 

for  a  security  clearance,

These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the 
complexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to  AG  ¶  2(a),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables 
known  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all 
available,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and  present,  favorable  and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 

 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  access  to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.”  

 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  

the  Government  predicated  upon 

 
A  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary 
 
relationship  with 
trust  and  confidence.  This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard 
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible 
extrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified 
information. 
 

Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms 
of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant  concerned.”  See  also  Exec.  Or.  12968,  Section  3.1(b)  (listing  multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   

Analysis 

 

 

 
Guideline B, Foreign Influence 
 

The security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG ¶ 6:       

Foreign  contacts  and  interests,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  business, 
financial,  and  property  interests,  are  a  national  security  concern  if  they 
result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern 
if they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or 
induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a 
way  inconsistent  with  U.S.  interests  or  otherwise  made  vulnerable  to 
pressure  or  coercion  by  any  foreign  interest.  Assessment  of  foreign 

 
7 
 

contacts  and  interests  should  consider  the  country  in  which  the  foreign 
contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations 
such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or 
sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 

AG ¶ 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   

information  or 

 
(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business 
or  professional  associate,  friend,  or  other  person  who  is  a  citizen  of  or 
resident  in  a  foreign  country  if  that  contact  creates  a  heightened  risk  of 
foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and 
 
(b)  connections  to  a  foreign  person,  group,  government,  or  country  that 
create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to 
protect  classified  or  sensitive 
the 
individual’s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing 
that information or technology. 
 
The  nature  of  a  nation’s  government,  its  relationship  with  the  United  States, 
and its human  rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant’s 
family  members  are  vulnerable  to  government  coercion.  The  risk  of  coercion, 
persuasion,  or  duress  is  significantly  greater 
foreign  country  has  an 
authoritarian  government,  a  family member is associated with or dependent upon the 
government,  or  the  country  is  known  to  conduct  intelligence  operations  against  the 
United  States.  In  considering  the  nature  of  the  government,  an  administrative  judge 
must  also  consider  any  terrorist  activity  in  the  country  at  issue.  See  generally  ISCR 
Case  No.  02-26130  at  3  (App.  Bd.  Dec.  7,  2006)  (reversing  decision  to  grant 
clearance  where  administrative  judge  did  not  consider  terrorist  activity  in  area  where 
family members resided). 
 

technology  and 

if 

the 

AG  ¶  7(a)  requires  substantial  evidence  of  a  “heightened  risk.”  The 
“heightened  risk” required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively 
low standard.  “Heightened risk” denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in 
having a family member living under a foreign government. 

 
Applicant has not communicated with his ex-girlfriend in Israel since 2007. When 
Applicant moved back to the United States from Israel in 2007, he had limited social 
media contact with her, her one sister, and several other individuals in Israel with whom 
he served in the Israeli military. He deleted all of his social media foreign contacts after 
he received the SOR. He has not responded and has no intentions of responding to any 
attempts  by  these  foreign  contacts  to  reconnect  on  social  media.  While  Applicant 
maintains  contact with one individual  with  whom he served in the Israeli military, this 
individual is a U.S. citizen and resident with no ties to the Israeli government or military.       
AG ¶¶ 7(a) and 7(b) are not established.

Guideline C, Foreign Preference 
 

The security concern for foreign preference is set out in AG ¶ 9:     
 
When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign 
country over the United States, then he or she may provide information or make 
decisions  that  are  harmful  to  the  interests  of  the  United  States.  Foreign 
involvement  raises  concerns  about  an  individual's  judgment,  reliability,  and 
trustworthiness  when  it  is  in  conflict  with  U.S.  national  interests  or  when  the 
individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the fact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen 
of  another  country  is  not  disqualifying  without  an  objective  showing  of  such 
conflict or attempt at concealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise 
of any right or privilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain 
recognition of a foreign citizenship. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 

AG ¶ 10. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   

 
(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: 

(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, position, or  
political office in a foreign government or military organization. 

Applicant’s service in the Israeli military from November 2004 to February 2006 

 

 

raises AG ¶ 10(d).   
 

Conditions that could mitigate foreign preference security concerns are provided  

under AG ¶ 11. The following are potentially applicable: 
 

(f)  the  foreign  preference,  if  detected,  involves  a  foreign  country,  entity,  or 
association that poses a low national security risk; and 
 
(g) civil employment or military service was authorized under U.S. law, or  
the employment or service was otherwise consented to as required by U.S. law. 
 
 
As  a  23  year  old,  Applicant  decided  that  serving  in  the  Israeli  military  would 
enable him to further his desired career in security in support of the U.S. Government. 
Since  his  longstanding  medical  condition,  which  he  determined  he  did  not  have  to 
disclose to the Israeli military, rendered him ineligible to serve in the U.S. military, he 
viewed  his  decision  as  a  reasonable  option.  That  the  United  States  and  Israel  were 
allies  with  mutual  adversaries  also  factored  into  his  decision.  He  has  matured  since 
then.  He  acknowledged  he  should  have  disclosed  his  medical  condition  to  the  Israeli 
military. His Israeli military service occurred between 11 and 13 years ago. He no longer 
has any ties to the Israeli government or military. He has never been an Israeli citizen, 
he  has  never  held  an  Israeli  passport,  and  he  has  never  held  an  Israeli  security 
clearance. AG ¶¶ 11(f) and 11(g) are applicable.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under  the  whole-person  concept,  the  administrative  judge  must  evaluate  an 
 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct  and  all  relevant  circumstances.  The  administrative  judge  should  consider  the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 

the  conduct, 

is  voluntary;  (6) 

the  nature,  extent,  and  seriousness  of 
to 

the 
the  conduct;  (2) 
(1) 
circumstances  surrounding 
include  knowledgeable 
participation;  (3)  the  frequency  and  recency  of  the  conduct;  (4)  the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which  participation 
the  presence  or  absence  of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for  the  conduct;  (8)  the  potential  for  pressure,  coercion,  exploitation,  or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 
Under  AG ¶  2(c), the  ultimate  determination  of  whether to  grant  eligibility  for a 
security  clearance  must  be  an  overall  commonsense  judgment  based  upon  careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 

I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B and C in my whole-person 
analysis.  After  weighing  the  disqualifying  and  mitigating  conditions  under  both 
guidelines,  and  evaluating  all  the  evidence  in  the  context  of  the  whole  person,  I 
conclude  Applicant  has  mitigated  the  foreign  influence  and  foreign  preference 
security  concerns.  Accordingly,  I  conclude  he  has  carried  his  burden  of  showing 
that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  continue  his  eligibility  for 
access to classified information.

security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
